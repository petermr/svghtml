    "The aim of this report was to discuss a complication resulting from a transconjunctival approach to treating an orbital fracture. A 30-year-old male patient presented with a fracture to the zygomatic orbital complex. He was treated with transconjunctival conventional surgical treatment. Two days after surgical treatment, the patient presented with secondary chemosis which was initially slight and then subsequently worsened. The clinical situation was managed with topical and systemic corticosteroids and resolved within one postoperative month. Two-year follow-up showed ptosis of the upper eyelid and limited infraversion in the affected eye. This unusual complication associated with an orbital trauma was resolved with minor functional alterations, although the consequences observed after 2 years were not completely satisfactory."
