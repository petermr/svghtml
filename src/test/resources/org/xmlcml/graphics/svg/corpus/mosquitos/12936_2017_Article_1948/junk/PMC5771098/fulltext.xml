Recently, we showed that glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (Gilz) expression by MSC is involved in their therapeutic effect by promoting the generation of regulatory T cells. However, the mechanisms underlying this pivotal role of Gilz remain elusive.</p><p><bold>Methods and Results</bold> In this study, we have uncovered evidence that Gilz modulates the phenotype and function of Th1 and Th17 cells likely by upregulating the level of Activin A and NO<sub>2</sub> secreted by MSC. Adoptive transfer experiments sustained this Gilz-dependent suppressive effect of MSC on Th1 and Th17 cell functions. In immunoregulatory MSC, obtained by priming with IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1;, Gilz was translocated to the nucleus and bound to the promoters of <italic>inos</italic> and <italic>Activin &#x003b2;A</italic> to induce their expression.

Presently, the development of new approaches for the treatment of autoimmune disorders aims to target different aspects of the generation and function of Th17 and Th1 cells and promising advances rely on T cell plasticity <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Indeed, a strong relationship between the regulatory T cell (Treg) and Th17 lineages has been reported, in part based on the observation that, in the presence of IL-6, endogenous TGF-&#x003b2; can induce the differentiation of Treg cells into Th17 cells <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. The converse possibility to generate T cells with regulatory function from Th17 cells has also been described <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, even if less evidenced. Moreover, although less described, a plasticity of Th1 cells has also been proposed. Indeed, a high dose allergen tolerance was shown to induce clonal expansion of specific IL-10-secreting T cells, which may switch <italic>in vivo</italic> from existing Th1-like allergen-specific cells <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.</p><p>An increasing number of results have highlighted the general capacity of polarized T cell subsets to adapt their phenotype and function in response to environmental tissue changes in the course of inflammatory reactions. In the attempts to force inflammatory Th17 cells to adopt a regulatory phenotype, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been extensively explored due to their potent T cell suppressive properties, described both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> a decade ago <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Among the possible mediators identified, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) play important roles in murine MSC (mMSC) <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. MSC immunoregulatory functions are not constitutive, but require a priming step. Several cytokines, including IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b1;, and IL-1&#x003b2;, trigger the expression of iNOS in mMSC <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. iNOS production by mMSC exerts regulatory effects through the generation of toxic reactive nitrogen species, as well as through the nitration of other molecules proximate to its source of production <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. MSC suppressive properties are in part mediated through the action of NO and result in the inhibition of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation as demonstrated both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Using activated mouse CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells under Th1 or Th17 skewing conditions <italic>in vitro</italic>, we previously reported that MSC inhibit the proliferation of Th1 and Th17 cells as well as their cytokine production. <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. The generation of a Th1 cell population co-producing IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-10 was recently proposed to be one of the mechanisms by which MSC exert their immunosuppressive properties <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. More recently, we showed that MSC negative regulation of Th17 responses restores the balance between Th17 and Treg cells in a murine model of autoimmune disease <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Although the mechanisms by which MSC exert their immunosuppressive effects have been the subject of many studies, the molecular regulation of the mediators responsible for MSC immunosuppressive effects, as well as the signaling pathways they activate in Th1 and Th17 cells remain largely unknown.</p><p>Glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (Gilz or TSC22D3) is a protein that binds to and inhibits major pro-inflammatory transcription factors including nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. Moreover, GILZ regulates signaling kinases Ras and Raf-1 leading to the inhibition of MAP kinases <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. A body of evidence indicates that Gilz is involved in the suppression of both innate and adaptive immune responses <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. Overexpression of Gilz drives the development of regulatory dendritic cells (DC), and thereby prevents the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by DC activated by CD40 ligand <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Tolerance-inducing regulatory DC, which express Gilz, enhance the differentiation of IL-10-producing CD25<sup>high</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CTLA4<sup>+</sup> Treg cells from na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. More recently, in an experimental model of arthritis, we have shown a pivotal role of Gilz in the therapeutic effects of MSC, through the generation of Treg cells bearing the CD4<sup>+</sup>ROR&#x003b3;T<sup>+</sup>IL-17<sup>+</sup>IL-10<sup>+</sup> signature <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. In line with this study, the generation of Treg cells induced by MSC through the up-regulation of developmental endothelial locus-1 (<italic>Del-1</italic>) expression was also recently shown to be Gilz-dependent <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. Although Gilz expression is required for MSC immunoregulatory activity, whether its expression directs the production of MSC immunosuppressive effect mediators remains to be demonstrated.</p><p>Activin A, a member of the TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily, exerts immunomodulatory effects on DC and T cells. DC both secrete and respond to Activin A. Autocrine actions of Activin A potently reduce DC capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as their T-cell stimulatory potential <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. Moreover, Activin A exerts immunomodulatory functions through the induction of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> IL-10<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> IL-10<sup>-</sup> Treg cells that inhibit Th1-driven responses <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. Activin A receptor type IIA (<italic>ActRIIA</italic>) expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> cells is dependent on TGF-&#x003b2;1 and IL-6 and is specific of and restricted to Th17 cells <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. Although these studies suggest that ActRIIA acts as a marker for Th17 cells and that Activin A might regulate the Th17/Treg balance, how pathogenic Th17 fate is shaped by extrinsic signals delivered by primed MSC focusing on their capacity to release Activin A has not been addressed.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated how Gilz, expressed by MSC, may affect the generation of Th1 and Th17 cells and addressed the role of Activin A in this aspect. Going further, we investigated the intracellular regulation of MSC immunosuppressive mediators directed by Gilz, identifying its binding sites on the promoters of <italic>inos</italic> and <italic>Activin &#x003b2;A</italic>. Finally, we explored signaling pathways and transcriptional events that skew Th17 differentiation and function. Our findings indicate that the expression of Gilz by MSC is essential for the release of the suppressive molecules NO<sub>2</sub> and Activin A. These effects underpin key aspects of the suppressive effects of MSC on T cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Gilz deficiency impairs MSC immunomodulatory function <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To assess the role of Gilz in MSC-mediated immunosuppressive function, we isolated MSC from bone marrow of Gilz-deficient mice and their wild-type Gilz<sup>+/+</sup> littermates, referred to as Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC and WT MSC respectively, as previously described <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>-<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. First, we investigated the phenotypic profile and multilineage differentiation potential of Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC <italic>in vitro</italic>. Both WT MSC and Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC were positive for Sca1, CD29, CD44 and CD105 and negative for CD11b and CD45 (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S1</xref>A). The multipotent nature of the cells was confirmed by their capacity to differentiate into the three main lineages relying on the expression of lineage-specific markers quantified by RT-qPCR. WT and Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC could be differentiated into chondrocytes, as shown by induction of collagen II (Col2b) and aggrecan (AGN), and into adipocytes, as revealed by increased expression of peroxysome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-&#x003b3; and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S1</xref>B). WT and Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC also differentiated into osteoblasts, expressing osteocalcin (OC) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), although the expression of these genes was significantly diminished in Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S1</xref> B).</p><p>Next, we assessed <italic>in vitro</italic> the immunosuppressive properties of WT and Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC on ConA-stimulated splenocytes by determining the percentage of proliferating cells stained with CellTrace Violet (CTV). After 3 days of co-culture, WT MSC significantly inhibited T cell proliferation, but in contrast Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC did not inhibit T cell proliferation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A-B). Since MSC have been described to negatively regulate both Th1 and Th17 responses, we analysed the effects of WT and Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC on the polarization of na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells toward Th1 and Th17 lineage. The specific combinations of cytokines and neutralizing antibodies used for each lineage (see Materials and Methods) induced IFN-&#x003b3;-producing cells (Th1) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C-F) and IL-17-producing cells (Th17), respectively, the latter cells also being positive for the Th17 lineage-specific transcription factor ROR-&#x003b3;T (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>G-J). The addition of WT MSC at day 0 of T cell differentiation resulted in a significant decrease in the frequency of both Th1 and Th17 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C-D, G-H). In comparison, the capacity of Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC to regulate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation into Th1 or Th17 cells was significantly impaired (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C-D, G-H). The role of Gilz on MSC regulatory effect was further evaluated by rescue experiments using Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC transfected with plasmid pCDNA3.1-GILZ (Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> pl. Gilz) (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S1</xref>C). While Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> pl. Gilz MSC were significantly more suppressive than WT MSC on CD4<italic><sup>+</sup></italic> T cells induced to differentiate into Th17 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>J), they did not affect the generation of Th1 cells as compared to the Th1 differentiating cells cultured alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>F). These results reinforce the key role of Gilz on the capacity of MSC to repress CD4<italic><sup>+</sup></italic> T cell differentiation toward Th17 lineage. We next assessed the effect of WT and Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC on mature Th1 or Th17 cell function. WT and Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC both significantly inhibited Th1 and Th17 cell cytokine expression after 3 days of co-culture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E, I). However, Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC were significantly less effective in reducing Th1 signature cytokine production than WT MSC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E, I), while suppression of Th17 signature cytokine production by WT and Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC was similar. Additionally, we tested the effect of another corticosteroid, aldosterone, on the capacity of MSC to repress the differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into Th1 or Th17 cells. First, we showed a dose-dependent increase of Gilz expression in human MSC treated with Aldosterone from a dose of 0.1 &#x000b5;M as compared to the control untreated MSC (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S2</xref>A). Moreover, the pre-treatment of MSC with aldosterone, TNF&#x003b1; and IFN&#x00263; significantly enhanced the suppressive effect of human MSC as compared to untreated MSC and MSC primed with either aldosterone or TNF&#x003b1; and IFN&#x00263; on PHA-activated PBMC proliferation (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S2</xref>B-C). In parallel, using mouse WT MSC, we observed that a 24 h treatment with 1 &#x000b5;M of aldosterone significantly increased their immunoregulatory effect on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell induction to differentiate into Th1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>F) or Th17 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>J). These results indicate that MSC immunosuppressive effects on Th1 and Th17 differentiation, and mature Th1 cell function, are dependent on MSC expression of Gilz, but that MSC immunosuppressive effects on mature Th17 cells are independent of Gilz.</p></sec><sec><title>Gilz deficiency impairs MSC immunomodulatory function <italic>in vivo</italic>
</title><p>We next assessed the immunosuppressive properties of WT and Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC <italic>in vivo</italic> using an adoptive T cell transfer model. To determine whether Gilz expressed by MSC affects proliferation and differentiation of Th1 and Th17 subsets in secondary lymphoid organs, we adoptively transferred CTV-labeled HNT TCR transgenic Thy1.1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) into BALB/c mice. Mice were then immunized with HA peptide prior to MSC treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). At day 4 after transfer, while we did not observe any difference in the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD90.1<sup>+</sup> cells in the spleen of MSC-treated mice as compared to the control mice, a significant increase was observed in mice treated with Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). However, the proliferation rate of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD90.1<sup>+</sup> cells was the same in the 3 different groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). Additionally, HNT Th1 and Th17 cells were detectable in spleens of immunized mice, with Th1 cells predominating (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D, F). Compared to non-treated mice, mice treated with WT MSC displayed a significant decrease in the frequency (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D, F) and absolute numbers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E,G) of Th1 and Th17 cells. In contrast, treatment with Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC had no effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D-G). Moreover, we observed an increase in the frequency of donor CD90.1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells producing IL-10 in the spleens of mice treated with WT MSC, but not Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>H-I). These results extend to <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions the requirement for Gilz for MSC to inhibit differentiation of na&#x000ef;ve T cells into Th1 and Th17 cells<italic>.</italic></p></sec><sec><title>The secretion of MSC immunosuppressive mediators is Gilz-dependent</title><p>Since the critical role of IFN-&#x003b3; in priming MSC-mediated suppression of immune cells is well established, we assessed the expression of the IFN&#x003b3; receptor (IFN&#x003b3;R1) by WT and Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC. FACS analysis indicated that IFN&#x003b3;R1 expression was higher in WT MSC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). This low expression level of IFN&#x003b3;R1 in Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC as compared to WT MSC could be related to their reduced immunosuppressive properties since IFN&#x003b3;R1 deficiency in MSC was described by their lack of immunosuppressive and therapeutic effects in an experimental model of GVHD <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. Next, we analysed MSC production of PGE<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>, which have been described to be associated with MSC immunomodulatory effects. WT and Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC cultured for 3 days in the presence of differentiating CD4-Th1 or CD4-Th17 cells secreted similar levels of PGE<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). In contrast, after co-culture with differentiating CD4-Th1 or CD4-Th17 cells, Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC secretion of NO2 was significantly lower than WT MSC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C). Finally, MSC secretion of Activin A was quantified. We observed abundant production of Activin A by WT MSC cultured in the presence of differentiating Th1 or Th17 cells, but significantly less Activin A was produced by Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC under the same conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D). These results indicate that Gilz-dependent suppressive effect of MSC on T cell subsets is associated with Activin A and NO<sub>2</sub> release.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of GILZ binding site motifs in <italic>Activin</italic> and <italic>inos</italic> promoter regions</title><p>We next investigated potential mechanisms for Gilz modulation of MSC Activin A and NO<sub>2</sub>. First, we studied Gilz expression profile in MSC both in basal condition (none) and in response to activation with TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3;. We thus performed an immunofluorescence analysis of Gilz expression in MSC to assess the effect of MSC stimulation on Gilz expression level and cellular distribution. We found, in response to MSC activation, a significant increase of Gilz expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A-B). Of note, the analysis of Gilz nuclear content revealed a significant increase of Gilz nuclear localization upon MSC stimulation as compared to non-activated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C). Next, we studied Gilz-specific transcriptional regulation of <italic>Activin &#x003b2;A</italic> and <italic>inos</italic>. To identify a putative DNA binding site, Mus musculus 5'UTR sequences for reported Gilz gene targets were retrieved from NCBI Nucleotide database <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>. The fasta sequences were used to look for over-represented motif enrichment between sequences using the Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools, RSAT <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, as described in Materials and Methods. This analysis revealed the consensus sequence AACTT as the strongest binding site candidate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D). Accordingly, we designed primers covering each AACTT sequence in the regions close to the promoters of <italic>Activin &#x003b2;A</italic> and <italic>inos</italic> genes, and studied the recruitment of Gilz on these genes using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)<italic>.</italic> In WT MSC, while no binding of Gilz at the <italic>inos</italic> promoter could be observed in unstimulated cells, activation with IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; induced a massive recruitment of Gilz to the <italic>inos</italic> promoter at +22nt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>E). As expected, in Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC, no significant recruitment of Gilz to the <italic>inos</italic> promoter was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>E). The stimulation of WT MSC by IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; also induced substantial recruitment of Gilz at the <italic>Activin &#x003b2;A</italic> promoter at -129 nt, compared to unstimulated cells in which no binding of Gilz on <italic>Activin &#x003b2;A</italic> promoter was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>F). Altogether these results suggest that under MSC activation, cytosolic Gilz is translocated to the nucleus where it binds to the <italic>inos</italic> and <italic>Activin &#x003b2;A</italic> promoters to regulate the expression of these two key mediators of MSC immunosuppressive effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Gilz-dependent secretion of Activin A by MSC impairs Th17 cell differentiation and function</title><p>To determine whether Activin A produced by MSC is critical for their immunomodulatory effects on Th1 or Th17 polarization, we determined the expression of Activin receptors (<italic>ActRIIA</italic> and <italic>ActRIB</italic>) on these T cell subsets. Both Th1 and Th17 cells expressed <italic>ActRIIA</italic> and <italic>ActRIB</italic>, but receptor expression was significantly higher in Th17 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). We thus further investigated the role of Activin A on the suppressive effect of MSC on Th17 cells. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells under Th17 polarizing conditions were co-cultured with WT or Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC for 3 days, in the presence or absence of Activin A. Compared to WT MSC, Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC inhibition of Th17 differentiation, as estimated by IL-17 and ROR-&#x00263;T expression, was significantly impaired (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). The addition of Activin A restored the ability of Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC to inhibit Th17 differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B) but had no effect on WT MSC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). Of note, the addition of Activin A to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells significantly reduced the frequency of Th17 cells, but these effects were less than the effects of co-culture with WT MSC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). To further study the key role of Activin A on MSC immunoregulatory role, we assessed the effect of Inhibin A, a natural Activin antagonist. The addition of Inhibin A in the co-culture of MSC with differentiating Th17 cells partially but significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of MSC on Th17 cell differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C). These results suggest that Gilz-dependent secretion of Activin A by MSC provides a mechanism through which MSC inhibit Th17 cell differentiation. Like other members of the TGF-&#x003b2; family, Activin A signals via phosphorylation of Smad2 and/or Smad3 proteins. Thus, we addressed the effects of MSC on the phosphorylation of these proteins in differentiating CD4-Th17 cells. Freshly isolated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were cultured under Th17 skewing conditions with or without WT MSC and/or Activin A. Both WT MSC and Activin A enhanced Smad3/Smad2 phosphorylation in T cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D). However, no additive effect of Activin A and MSC was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D). We previously showed increased expression of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in MSC when cultured with T cells undergoing Th17 differentiation <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Since Activin A acts as an enhancer of the TGF-&#x003b2;1-induced generation of iTreg, and that Treg and Th17 cells differentiate in a mutually exclusive fashion <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, we addressed whether IL-10-producing cells were generated under Th17-skewing conditions in presence of MSC and/or Activin A. In parallel with the suppression of Th17 differentiation by culture with MSC or Activin A shown above, a significant increase in the percentage of T cells producing IL-10 was observed in response to MSC or Activin A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>F). No effect on Foxp3 expression level was observed in T cells cultured under the same conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>E). Collectively, these data suggest that Activin A production by MSC represses the Th17 differentiation program accompanied by Smad3/2 activation and the generation of IL-10 producing T cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms by which Gilz sustains the capacity of MSC to regulate Th1 and Th17 responses <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We show that this effect is mediated by an increased secretion of Activin A and NO<sub>2</sub> by MSC. The priming of MSC with IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; towards an immunosuppressive phenotype induces Gilz translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus, where it binds to <italic>Activin A</italic> and <italic>inos</italic> promoters. These data demonstrate a direct regulation of the transcription of these two genes associated with the immunosuppressive effect of Gilz in MSC. Moreover, our results show that Gilz-dependent release of Activin A by MSC induces the phosphorylation of Smad3/Smad2 in T cells, which promotes a switch from Th17 cells towards an IL-10 expressing regulatory T cell phenotype. We further demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> that the immunosuppressive effect of MSC on activated T cells undergoing Th1 or Th17 differentiation, and on mature Th1 cells, is dependent on Gilz expression. In an adoptive transfer study, we showed that MSC expression of Gilz was required for the inhibition of the transferred Th1 and Th17 cells in immunized mice as well as for the increase in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells producing IL-10 in response to MSC. These results are in line with our previous study showing that MSC prevention of CIA progression by repressing both Th1 and Th17 responses in secondary lymphoid organs, enabling the generation of Treg cells producing IL-10, required the expression of Gilz by MSC <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>.</p><p>Th17 differentiation, induced by low concentrations of TGF-&#x003b2;, enables T cells to express low levels of T-bet and thereby increases the tendency of Th17 cells to give rise to Th1 cells <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>. In contrast, high concentrations of TGF-&#x003b2; inhibit Th17 cell differentiation <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>. Therefore, depending on the concentration, TGF-&#x003b2; might exhibit different functions by either promoting Th17 or Treg cell differentiation <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. It was also reported that Activin A and TGF-&#x003b2; signalling pathways converge with regard to Smad2 and 3 during generation of Treg cells <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>. We recently showed that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells under Th17-skewing conditions induce significant increases in TGF-&#x003b2;1 expression in MSC <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. In the present study we demonstrate that under the same conditions Activin A production by MSC was significantly enhanced. We hypothesized that TGF-&#x003b2;1 and Activin A produced by MSC co-cultured with T cells under Th17 skewing conditions inhibits Th17 differentiation, in favour of Treg. In line with this hypothesis, we showed in the present study that Activin A alone significantly repressed the Th17 molecular program of T cells. In parallel, we demonstrated that addition of Activin A to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells skewed their differentiation into Th17 cells to a population of cells producing IL-10. In accordance with a study showing that Activin A induces the generation of Treg cells without changing the frequency of Foxp3-expressing CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, we did not observe any change in Foxp3 expression level in Activin A-induced CD4<sup>+</sup> IL-10-producing cells. This suggests that the immunomodulatory effect of Activin A on Th17 cell responses relies on the induction of IL-10. Together, these results designate Activin A as an additional mediator of MSC immunosuppressive properties. Accordingly, Activin A treatment significantly decreased the frequency of Th17 cells, but to a lesser extent than the inhibition observed in response to co-culture with WT MSC, suggesting that factors produced by MSC additional to Activin A mediate their suppressive functions. However, Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC lacked the effects of WT MSC on Th17 cell generation, confirming a requirement for Gilz in Th17 suppression mediated by MSC. Finally, Activin A treatment restored the immunomodulatory properties of Gilz<sup>-/-</sup> MSC, suggesting that the regulation of the Th17/Treg balance by MSC might be in part mediated by a Gilz-dependent enhancement of Activin A production. Our findings introduce Activin A as a novel member in the family of these regulatory factors produced by MSC.</p><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first one to report a Gilz-dependent regulation of Activin A and NO<sub>2</sub> production by MSC. Thus, we provide evidence that the suppressive effects of MSC on T cells undergoing Th1 or Th17 differentiation and on mature Th1 cells are mandatory Gilz-dependent. Indeed, we dissected and highlighted a mechanism explaining the role of Gilz in MSC immunosuppressive effects on T cells. We demonstrated that, in inflammatory conditions, factors from the microenvironment such as TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3;, induce in MSC the translocation of Gilz protein from the cytosolic to the nuclear compartment where it directly modulates the expression of Activin A and NO<sub>2</sub> by binding specific motifs in the promoters of <italic>Activin &#x003b2;A</italic> and <italic>inos</italic>, respectively. In primed MSC, Gilz might <italic>act</italic> as a molecular <italic>switch</italic> of Activin A synthesis that after its secretion by MSC is able to bind to its receptors ActRIIA and ActRIB present at the surface of Th17 cells. By signalling via the Smad2 and/or Smad3 protein pathway, Activin A ultimately induces the transcription of IL-10 in Th17 cells and inhibition of IL-17, switching the differentiation of the pro-inflammatory Th17 lineage toward a Treg cell phenotype and function. In conclusion, this study, by expanding the knowledge on the molecular mechanisms that mediate the immunosuppressive effects of MSC on T cells, suggests a new paradigm of immunomodulation by MSC. The inhibition of Th17 cell development by Gilz-expressing MSC offers a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of various autoimmune diseases that are mediated by Th17 cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal studies were conducted according to the European guidelines for animal welfare (2010/63/EU).
