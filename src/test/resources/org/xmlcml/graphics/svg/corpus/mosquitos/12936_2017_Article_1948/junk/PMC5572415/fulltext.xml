The pathogenic effects of repeated viral reactivation in infected neurons are still unknown. Several studies have reported that during HSV-1 epithelial infection, the virus could modulate diverse cell signaling pathways remodeling the Golgi apparatus (GA) membranes, but the molecular mechanisms implicated, and the functional consequences to neurons is currently unknown. Here we report that infection of primary neuronal cultures with HSV-1 triggers Src tyrosine kinase activation and subsequent phosphorylation of Dynamin 2 GTPase, two players with a role in GA integrity maintenance. Immunofluorescence analyses showed that HSV-1 productive neuronal infection caused a scattered and fragmented distribution of the GA through the cytoplasm, contrasting with the uniform perinuclear distribution pattern observed in control cells. In addition, transmission electron microscopy revealed swollen cisternae and disorganized stacks in HSV-1 infected neurons compared to control cells. Interestingly, PP2, a selective inhibitor for Src-family kinases markedly reduced these morphological alterations of the GA induced by HSV-1 infection strongly supporting the possible involvement of Src tyrosine kinase. Finally, we showed that HSV-1 tegument protein VP11/12 is necessary but not sufficient to induce Dyn2 phosphorylation. Altogether, these results show that HSV-1 neuronal infection triggers activation of Src tyrosine kinase, phosphorylation of Dynamin 2 GTPase, and perturbation of GA integrity. These findings suggest a possible neuropathogenic mechanism triggered by HSV-1 infection, which could involve dysfunction of the secretory system in neurons and central nervous system.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HSV-1</kwd><kwd>Golgi fragmentation</kwd><kwd>neuronal dysfunction</kwd><kwd>Src</kwd><kwd>dynamin</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>vesicular trafficking</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient&#x000ed;fico y Tecnol&#x000f3;gico<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002850</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">FONDECYT REGULAR 1150574</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="74"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="9658"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a DNA enveloped virus, ubiquitous, neurotropic, and the most common pathogenic cause of sporadic acute encephalitis in humans (Whitley, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Steiner, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). HSV-1 has the ability to establish and maintain a life-long latent infection in peripheral neurons with frequent reactivation episode, generally asymptomatic (Kastrukoff et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Flowerdew et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Tsalenchuck et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have suggested HSV-1 as an environmental risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), in part because in herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) the main regions affected are the temporal and frontal cortices and the hippocampus (Saldanha et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Jamieson et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). In addition, HSV-1 DNA has been detected in the brain of normal aged individuals as well as in AD patients (Itzhaki et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Wozniak et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><p>The fact that the virus is present in the CNS of 70% of the population over 50 years old (Wozniak et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) suggests that recurrent reactivations in infected individuals could lead to neuronal alterations (for review see Itzhaki et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, the pathogenic mechanism of HSV-1 at the central nervous system (CNS), and the possibility of neuronal dysfunction are yet unknown (Mori, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Roizman et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Many reports have demonstrated that viruses that establish persistent infections interact with members of the cellular Src family kinases (SFKs), which regulate several signaling pathways involved in cellular morphology, motility, proliferation, and survival (Miller et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Collete and Olive, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; MacDonald et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Pan et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Szalm&#x000e1;s et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; McCarthy et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In this context, Liang and Roizman (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) demonstrated that HSV-1 regulates the activity of members of the SFKs, specifically Src kinases, inducing optimal viral replication in infected epithelial cells. Later, it was discovered that activation of Src tyrosine kinase is triggered by phosphorylation of its residue Y424, whereas persistent activation affects integrity of the Golgi apparatus (GA) in a variety of cell types (Weller et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). One Src substrate implicated in this process is the large GTPase Dynamin 2 (Dyn2) (Weller et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Activated Src triggers Dyn2 phosphorylation at two different positions, Y231 and Y597, modifications that positively regulate its GTPase activity (Cao et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Dyn2 is a GTPase that controls the GA dynamics as well as <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) fragmentation during the secretory process in normal and neoplastic cells (Ishida et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). It also participates in synaptic vesicle recycling, post-synaptic receptor internalization, neurosecretion, and extension of neuronal processes in the nervous system (Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Jamett et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Interestingly, the DynY231/597F tyrosine phospho-mutant reduced the fragmentation of the GA (Weller et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), altogether demonstrating that both, Src and Dyn2, regulate the integrity and function of the GA (Weller et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Although, Dyn2 has several isoforms, the involvement of Dyn2 in neurological conditions points to a critical function of this isoform in the nervous system (Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Jamett et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Interestingly, Campadelli et al. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) had previously reported that HSV-1 infection of Vero and Hep-2 cells causes fragmentation and dispersal of Golgi proteins and redistribution of glycoprotein and glycoplipids processed through the GA. These results were interpreted as processes required for late events of the viral reproductive cycle, characterized by maturation, processing, and sorting of virions (Campadelli et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). However, the potentially deleterious effects that structural and functional changes of the GA during HSV-1 neuronal infection could have on synaptic vesicle transport along axons have not been evaluated. In fact, previous studies have found that the fragmentation and dispersion of the GA precedes neuronal death triggered by excitotoxins, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum stress (Chiu et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Lane et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Machamer, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). These events have also been observed in several neurodegenerative diseases models (Stieber et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Gonatas et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Interestingly, previous studies in Jurkat T cells have shown that lymphocyte-specific Src family kinase Lck is activated during that HSV-1 infection (Zahariadis et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Wagner and Smiley, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In fact, the tegument protein VP11/12 has been identified as one specific substrate of Lck in T cells (Zahariadis et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Wagner and Smiley, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In this regard, the C-terminal region of VP11/12 contains tyrosine-based motifs predicted to bind the SH2 domains of SFKs (Strunk et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether HSV-1 neuronal infection triggers activation of Src tyrosine kinase resulting in alteration of the structure and integrity of GA and to study the possible involvement of the HSV-1 tegument protein VP11/12 in this process. Our results show that HSV-1 perturbs the GA in infected neurons, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy studies. Consistent with these findings, we show that HSV-1 neuronal infection activates Src tyrosine kinase and Dyn2 GTPase, two players functionally implicated in the maintenance of the GA integrity. Finally, we determined that VP11/12 is required for efficient HSV-1 replication in neurons, for Dyn2 activation and fragmentation of the GA during HSV-1 replicative life cycle. Therefore, we propose that HSV-1 neuronal infection have a profound impact in the neuronal secretory system explaining part of the deleterious effects of HSV-1 in central nervous system in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Biosafety methodology</title><p>Our laboratories have the necessary suitable procedures and biosafety equipment for biological elements and chemicals disposal, according to the Safety Manual of Procedures and Handling of Wastes from the Universidad Austral de Chile, and Bio-safety Regulations from CONICYT.

The animals were sacrificed by lethal doses of intravenous sodium pentabarbitone (200 mg/kg of total weight). Death was confirmed observing cessation of heartbeat and respiration, and absence of reflexes, in agreement with international standards (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lal.org.uk">http://www.lal.org.uk</ext-link>). Briefly, embryos (E17) were removed from mice and dissected cortex pairs. All the tissues were collected in a conical tube containing Hibernate-E complete medium (Gibco, NY, USA) supplemented with 200 mM glutamine and B-27 50X. The tissue was treated with 0.25% trypsin at 37&#x000b0;C for 5 min and then disaggregated by mechanical grinding with a sterile, fire-polished glass Pasteur pipette, in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were seeded onto coverslips or in 35-mm plastic dishes pre-coated with 10 &#x003bc;g/ml poly-lysine (mol. wt &#x0003e; 350 kDa; Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St Louis, MO, USA). After 30 min in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% air at 37&#x000b0;C, floating cells were removed and attached cells cultured for 7 days in Neurobasal Medium (Gibco, NY, USA) supplemented with B27 (Gibco, NY, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin, and 0.5 mM L-glutamine (Nalgene, Rochester, NY, USA).</p><p>HSV-1 (strain F) used in this study including HSV-1 wild type and HSV-1 &#x00394;UL46 mutant (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>) were kindly supplied by Dr. Bernard Roizman, Northwestern University, Chicago, USA. All virus stocks were prepared and titrated from infected Vero cells (Ejercito et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>; Zambrano et al., <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Infection protocols</title><p>For kinetics studies, infections with HSV-1 wild type or HSV-1 &#x00394;UL46 mutant were carried out for 1 h in a DMEM containing 10% FBS, at multiplicity of infection (moi) of 10. Following infections, viruses were removed by washings, the medium was replaced by a serum-free medium consisting of Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 1X and 0.5 mM L-glutamine, and the cells were further cultured for 4, 8, and 18 h post-infection (hpi). For the Src kinase inhibition experiment, cells were treated with the PP2 inhibitor (20 &#x003bc;M; Sigma-Aldrich Corporation St Louis, MO, USA) for 12 h before infection and maintained during infection with the virus.</p></sec><sec><title>TCID50 assay protocol</title><p>To determine the amount of infectious viral particles, present in the cell extracts, we performed the TCID50 assay (Tissue Cultured Infective Dose). Vero cells were plated in a 96-well plate and grown, until they reached 80% of confluence. Serial dilutions of the virus sample were made (quadruplicate) and incubated with the Vero cells for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C. Media were aspirated and fresh DMEM containing 5% FBS was added, incubating the plates at 37&#x000b0;C for 4 days. Subsequently, the medium was removed, and cells were incubated with 75% methanol for 15 min and stained with crystal violet for 1 min. The plates were washed with water and the number of wells in which the cell monolayer was detached from each dilution was counted. The titer of the virus stock was expressed as the TCID50, which was calculated using a statistical Excel program. The viral titer (PFU/ml) was achieved by multiplying the factor 0.69 TCID50/mL according to the Reed-Muench method (Reed and Muench, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1938</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorescence microscopy and quantitative analysis</title><p>Non-infected neurons (MOCK) and HSV-1 infected neurons, moi = 10, (treated or untreated with PP2 inhibitor) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS 1X for 30 min, washed in PBS 1X, and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS 1X for 5&#x02013;10 min. Cells were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with the following primary antibodies diluted in PBS 1X. We used primary antibodies against the following proteins: HSV-1 ICP8 viral protein (sc-53329, clone 10A3, Santa Cruz), p-Src (sc-101802, Santa Cruz; recommended for the detection of mouse Src phosphorylated at Tyr424), Giantin (ab 248526, Abcam), and p-Dyn2 (Dyn2 phosphorylated at Tyr231; antibody donated by Dr. MacNiven, Mayo Clinic, Rochester-Minessota, USA). Finally, cells were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa-488 or Alexa-594, and nuclei were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen). Fluorescence images were obtained using a Zeiss Axioskope A1 epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, G&#x000f6;ttingen, Germany) with a digital video camera (Nikon DXM 1200). The images obtained (at least five microscopic fields per each sample) were processed with Adobe Photoshop 6.0. The phenotype of the GA was categorized according to normal or fragmented patterns observed by staining with the antibody against Giantin (a Golgi marker). The normal phenotype corresponded to homogenous staining clustered in the perinuclear region. The fragmented phenotype (FRAGM) corresponded to punctate staining scattered throughout the cytoplasm. The percentage of cells showing normal or fragmented distribution of Giantin was calculated from five digital images acquired for each condition. In addition, we measured the distance of Giantin positive structures to the nucleus as a parameter of GA dispersion. To this, immunofluorescence images (10 cells for each condition) obtained from infected neurons with either HSV-1 wild type or HSV-1&#x00394;UL46 treated in the absence or presence of PP2 inhibitor were analyzed in each condition. Using Image J software (U.S. National Institutes of Health), each image was calibrated (pixels/&#x003bc;m), and the maximal distance of the Golgi marker with respect to the nucleus was measured in cells randomly selected. The data represent the average of maximal distance from the nucleus obtained from three independent experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Electron microscopy analysis</title><p>For Electron Microscopy analysis, we used neurons at a confluence of 2.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. Neurons were growth in Neurobasal media supplemented with B27, glutamine and 1% antibiotics. Once the time of infection was finished, the Neurobasal media was removed and each plate with cells was gently washed with PBS 1X. Then, neurons were fixed for 3 min at room temperature in 3% glutaraldehyde, 0.01% picric acid, and 50 mM cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. Cells were collected in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, and then centrifuged at 3,000&#x02013;5,000 rpm for 3&#x02013;5 min at room temperature until a pellet of cells appeared. The pellet was incubated in the same buffer with 1% OsO<sub>4</sub> and then immersed in 2% uranyl acetate, dehydrated in a gradient of ethanol and acetone, and infiltrated in Epon resin (Ted Pella Inc.). Ultrathin sections were obtained using an ultramicrotome (Reichert). Thin 50&#x02013;80 nm sections were obtained and mounted in copper grids and contrasted using 1% uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Observations of the grids were made using a Phillips Tecnai 12 (Eindhoven) at 80 kV and photographed using a Mega view G2 camera (Olympus) (Villegas et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The Golgi morphology was analyzed in the sections obtained previously. The normal Golgi was defined as a highly ordered, pericentriolar, ribbon-like structure, and the fragmented Golgi was defined as scattered dots (not connected) in the perinuclear region, or multiple mini-Golgi (isolated dots) dissociated from the major GA. For the quantification of Golgi cisternae lumen width (&#x003bc;m) in mock- and HSV-1-infected cells, or in cells treated with the Src inhibitor PP2 (20 &#x003bc;M), we also quantified the maximum length of GA cisternae (designated as maximum luminal width) by measuring the cisternae diameters assuming circular structures. A number of 3&#x02013;5 GA cisternae for each time were analyzed by EM. All images were analyzed using Image J software (Joshi et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>MTT assay</title><p>Cell viability was determined by the MTT-based colorimetric assay (3 - [4,5 &#x02013; dimethyl thiazol -2 -yl] -2,5- diphenyl tetrazolium bromide), Sigma-Aldrich Corporation St Louis, MO, USA) modified by Liu and Schubert (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Neurons were cultured in 96-well plates until they reached 80% of confluence in a final volume of 100 &#x003bc;l of medium containing 10% FBS and without phenol red, and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After kinetic infection, the mitochondrial activity was measured by the modified MTT assay (Mosmann, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>). This assay involves determining mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity in intact cells by incubation for 4 h at 37&#x000b0;C with MTT (5 mg/ml MTT solution per well). After the incubation, the resulting complex was solubilized by the addition of an acidified ethanol solution, and the absorbance was read at 570 nm on a Microplate reader (Thermo, Multiskan MS), and the results were expressed as a percentage (%) of the control cells. The results were analyzed statistically using the non-parametric Student <italic>t</italic>-test.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>For protein analysis, neurons from different treatments were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer 1X supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation St Louis, MO, USA) and the protein concentration was quantified with Micro BCA&#x02122; Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA USA). Equal amounts of protein (20 &#x003bc;g per lane) were loaded and separated by gradient SDS-PAGE (8&#x02013;20% polyacrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA USA). The membranes were incubated at room temperature in blocking solution (2% BSA in TBS-Tween), and then incubated overnight with primary antibodies diluted in TBS-1% BSA: anti-&#x003b2;-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation St Louis, MO, USA ab6096), and p-Src (sc-101802), anti-Src (sc-5266), and anti-Dyn II (sc-166526) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

One known substrate of Src tyrosine kinase is Dyn2, which is phosphorylated at Tyr231, residue located in the activation loop of its GTPase domain that under phosphorylation triggers its GTPase activity (Ahn et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Ahn, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Shajahan, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). As shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,B</xref> levels of phosphorylated Src-Tyr424 (p-Src) and phosphorylated Dyn2-Tyr231 (p-Dyn2) were significantly increased during early HSV-1 infection (4 hpi) of neurons, reaching maximal values at 18 hpi, and compared with un-infected neurons (MOCK). To control specific activation of Src tyrosine kinase by HSV-1 infection we treated cells with the selective Src kinase inhibitor named PP2 (20 &#x003bc;M) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). We observed that treatment with PP2 caused a significant reduction in the phosphorylated levels of p-Src and p-Dyn2 (&#x02265;93 and 44%, respectively) after 8 hpi (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C,D</xref>). Confocal immunofluorescence analysis confirmed these results observing a notorious increase of p-Src and p-Dyn2 in HSV-1 infected neurons compared to MOCK cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Moreover, we observed that both, p-Src and p-Dyn2, distributed into a perinuclear region in infected neurons. Interestingly, the expression of viral protein ICP8 was delayed by the treatment with PP2, suggesting that HSV-1 replication and late viral expression could also be affected by specific Src tyrosine kinase inhibition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Src kinase and dynamin 2 activate during HSV-1 neuronal infection.

We observed that Giantin, a conserved protein of the GA, shows a scattered and fragmented distribution through the cytoplasm, compared to the highly ordered, pericentriolar, ribbon-like structure distribution observed in mock cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, compared to Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we characterized the effect of a deleted HSV-1 version that lacks the viral gene UL46 (HSV-1&#x00394;UL46), comparing this version to the wild type. First, normalized data from Western blotting analysis showed an indistinguishable response regarding the levels of phosphorylated Src-Tyr424 between these two HSV-1 versions, strongly suggesting that VP11/12 is dispensable for the activation of Src tyrosine kinase (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A,B</xref>). Next, we analyzed the relative levels of p-Dyn2 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A,C</xref>). We showed that cells infected with HSV-1 &#x00394;UL46 had a significant decrease in Dyn2 activation, compared to cells infected with HSV-1 wild type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).

We observed that lack in VP11/12 reduced the scattered and fragmented distribution of Giantin observed with the HSV-1 wild-type version (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Quantification analysis of the distance of Giantin positive structures to the nucleus showed a significant reduction in this parameter at 8 and 18 hpi (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), however in these cells, viral replication was significantly reduced in comparison with those infected with the wild type virus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>).

However, the molecular basis for Golgi fragmentation and its effects on disease progression have remained largely unexplored. Diverse studies have previously shown that HSV-1 uses the secretory pathway of epithelial cells, affecting the functional organization of the GA in these cells (Campadelli et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Avitabile et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>).</p><p>In the same context, a previous study showed that expression of a constitutively active form of Src tyrosine kinase resulted in GA fragmentation, which depends on Dyn2 activity (Weller et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Furthermore, Dyn2 has also been shown to participate in membrane trafficking pathways including endocytosis playing a role in membrane fusion and in the regulation of microtubule and actin cytoskeleton dynamics (Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Jamett et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, how Dyn2 controls infectivity and productive viral infection is not yet known. Here we demonstrated that HSV-1 productive infection triggers activation of Src and Dyn2, however the precise step that is regulated by this GTPase during HSV-1 viral infection is still a mystery.</p><p>Here we show that infection of primary neurons with HSV-1 triggers activation of Src tyrosine kinase and its downstream target Dyn2, leading to GA fragmentation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Activation of Src was evidenced by increased phosphorylation of the conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr 424), which lies in the activation loop of the kinase domain. Phosphorylation of this site is present in the most highly active forms of SFKs and it appears to be the most important phosphorylation site for maximal kinase activity (Ingley, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). One possible explanation by which HSV-1 could trigger activation of Src is the direct binding of the virus to cellular receptors. Most herpesviruses use integrins as key components for cell entry (Campadelli-Fiume et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). One example is the interaction of virion gH/gL glycoproteins with &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;8-integrin receptor, which is located at lipid microdomains and requires Dyn2 for viral entry (Gianni et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Similarly, the interaction of Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpes virus (KSHV) gB protein with host cell surface receptors activates the host integrin-dependent focal adhesion kinase (FAK), that leads to binding of the SH2 domain of Src family kinases (Veettil et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Interestingly, Wang et al. (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) demonstrated that Dyn2 is recruited to focal adhesions (FAs) by a direct interaction with FAK, and Src&#x02013;mediated activation of Dyn2 promotes FA turnover by inducing the endocytosis of integrins. Another possible mechanism is the one based on the binding of HSV-1 to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which was previously shown to be quickly and transiently activated and clustered when the virus was added to neuronal cells (Zheng et al., <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In this context, SFK have been shown to be necessary for signaling from EGFR to PI3K (Reddy et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Moreover, EGFR is involved in activation of SFKs and other cellular tyrosine kinases adjacent to the membrane, promoting the formation of an intracellular signaling platform, responsible for regulating the cellular cytoskeleton and adequate maintenance of neuronal function, a strategy that allows maturation, trafficking and egress of a new viral progeny from infected cells (Zheng et al., <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Proposed model for mechanisms underlying dysruption of the GA during HSV-1 neuronal infection. Alteration of the normal neuronal GA morphology by HSV-1 involves the activation of Src kinase signaling induced by the interaction of HSV-1 with cellular receptor(s). The prolonged activation of Src kinase activity during HSV-1 early infection triggers phosphorylation of Dyn2 (Tyr231), enhancement of Dyn2 assembly and GTPase activity at the GA. High Dyn2 activity induces membrane vesiculation, affecting GA morphology and function. In addition, assembly of HSV-1 virions ends with the acquisition of the viral envelope at the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi, followed by their release from vesicles that emerge from the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network. We propose that activation of Src kinase and Dyn2 at the GA perturbs Golgi integrity affecting the secretory pathway in neurons. Consequently, alteration of the normal secretory pathway could impair and compromise neuronal function, and thereby contribute to neurodegenerative disorders development.

This is the case for the tegument protein VP11/12, which utilizes tyrosine-based motifs within its C-terminal region to bind the SH2 domains of Src kinases family members, in particular, Lck, stimulating the PI3K/Akt pathway by mimicking an activated growth factor receptor in T cells (Strunk et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Concerning this last mechanism, here we show that VP11/12 is not critical for Src and Dyn2 activation in neurons, but surprisingly partially contributes to GA fragmentation, suggesting that in addition to VP11/12, HSV-1 could use other viral proteins, to articulate Src and Dyn2 signaling, involved in the changes in the GA triggered by viral infection.</p><p>Regardless the actual mechanism(s) used by the virus to activate Src, our results show that Src activation leads to an increased phosphorylation/activation status of the GTPase Dyn2. In fact, phosphorylation of Dyn2 was correlated with Src activation and Golgi fragmentation during the course of infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Although different tyrosine kinases could phosphorylate Dyn2, the fact that treatment with PP2, previous to HSV-1 infection, reduced the levels of p-Dyn2 strongly suggest the involvement of Src or a closed related member of the SFKs family. Concerning the subcellular localization described for Src, Chu et al. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) showed that before activation, Src is concentrated on one side of the perinuclear compartment associated to the GA. This localization is important for its ability to induce polarized movement to the cell periphery shortly after kinase activation. Intriguingly, we observed that p-Src is mainly distributed in the perinuclear region during the course of HSV-1 infection (4&#x02013;18 hpi). Because intracellular distribution of Src tyrosine kinase depends on intact microtubules (Arnette et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), it is plausible that concentration of p-Src to the perinuclear region could be the result of microtubule instability along the axons, due to the cleavage, hyperphosphorylation, and concentration of tau protein by HSV-1 (Zambrano et al., <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) or the activation of Dyn2 (Ishida et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). On the other hand, it has been reported that direct association of Dyn2 with cortactin, an actin-binding protein, reduces association of Dyn2 to the GA (Cao et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Therefore, concentration of active Dyn2 at the perinuclear region during HSV-1 infection could be also a consequence of an altered interaction of p-Dyn2 with cortactin. In this context, it is tempting to speculate that HSV-1 favors sequestration of activated versions of Src and Dyn2 at the perinuclear region to facilitate assembly and progeny egress process. The assembly of HSV-1 virions ends with the acquisition of the viral envelope proteins at the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi, followed by their release from vesicles that emerge from the TGN (Avitabile et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). Our findings suggest that activation of Src tyrosine kinase and Dyn2 by HSV-1 infection regulates Golgi integrity and vesiculation during the secretory process.</p><p>Our results showed that HSV-1 triggers GA fragmentation in neurons. In agreement with these findings, previous studies have demonstrated that HSV-1 infection induces a similar phenotype in epithelial cells, which has been confirmed by electron microscopy (Campadelli et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). Moreover, we showed that this phenotype was rescued by PP2.</p><p>Ultrastructural analysis showed that the average maximum cisternal width (0.194 &#x003bc;m) of HSV-1 infected neurons treated with PP2, was similar to the width determined in mock neurons treated with PP2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Thus, the results obtained are consistent with the report of Weller et al. (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) showing that the transit of a viral protein (G protein) of the Stomatitis vesicular virus in epithelial cells generates substantial activation of the Src kinase, phosphorylation of dynamin 2 at the tyrosine residue (Y231), and GA alteration. In addition, this phenomenon was prevented by pretreating cell cultures with PP2 or by expressing a non-phosphorylable mutant of Dyn2 (Dyn2YF), or deficient in its activation (Dyn2K44A).</p><p>On the other hand, Liang et al. (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) and Liang and Roizman (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) suggested that SFKs modulation during epithelial infection might be dependent on HSV-1 viral proteins such as ICP0, where physical interaction between ICP0 and kinases occurs through sequences between residues 245&#x02013;510 of ICP0 and SFKs SH3 domain. Likewise, the viral protein VP11/12 also interacts with SFKs members (LcK) in lymphoid cells, potentiating its own post-translational modifications and activation of LcK (Wang et al., <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). VP11/12 is one of the most abundant HSV-1 tegumental proteins, having a role as a structural component of the mature virion and as a modulator of cellular and/or viral functions on infected cells. Its participation was identified in cellular signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt (Wagner and Smiley, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Strunk et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and it has the ability to associate to the plasma membrane of HSV-1 infected cells (Willard, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Murphy et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>These results contribute with new evidence regarding the possible role of the Src kinase dependent signaling pathway on the structure and function of neuronal GA during HSV-1 infection. Interestingly, our findings suggest that the structural alteration of the GA observed during neuronal infection is at least partially dependent on the signaling platform linked to Src kinase, because inhibiting its activity during infection attenuated significantly the changes observed at the GA level. Evidence suggests that the alteration of GA in neurons is an early and probably irreversible event that could potentiate the neurodegenerative process, but not a secondary consequence of the apoptotic process (Gonatas et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). However, despite the relevance of these findings, few previous reports have contributed with insights about possible candidates that could explain GA disturbances reported in neurons. Therefore, our results are the first to link HSV-1 infection with activation of the Src pathway and alterations of the GA in neurons, disturbances that can be responsible for the deleterious effects of HSV-1 in central nervous system in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>We used 20 pregnant mice, (considering minimal use of animal to validate results), provided by the Unit of Mice Breeding at the Department of Immunology.
