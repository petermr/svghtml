This study aims to assess and compare the welfare status of working horses in two administrative regions of Chile and to determine how owners perceive their horses. Horses&#x02019; welfare status was assessed through direct indicators (direct observation and clinical examination) and indirect indicators (an interview with the owner). Owners&#x02032; perceptions of their horses were determined through a discourse analysis of their statements. In total, 100 horses and 100 owners were assessed. Results showed a low prevalence of health problems and negative behavior responses among horses in the two regions evaluated. Significant associations were found between inadequate body condition and the absence of deworming, and between hoof abnormalities and a low frequency of shoeing. Between regions, significant differences were found in the presence of lesions and the person responsible for horseshoeing. In regards to the owners&#x02032; appreciations, two differing perceptions of working horses were found: a predominantly affective perception and a perception of the animal as a working instrument. Although the instrumental perception was more frequent in the Araucania region, the affective perception was widely shared by both owner populations. The results reveal a good welfare status in working horses and suggest that both affective and instrumental perceptions of these animals can coexist.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>equine welfare</kwd><kwd>working horses</kwd><kwd>urban draught horses</kwd><kwd>semantic analysis</kwd><kwd>human-animal relationship</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-animals-07-00056"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>In developing countries such as Chile [<xref rid="B1-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], working animals provide an essential resource of power for millions of people who live in poverty [<xref rid="B2-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the case of working equids, there is increasing evidence of their socioeconomic contribution to human livelihood through their direct and indirect impact in generating income for thousands of households worldwide [<xref rid="B3-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It has been reported that the welfare state of these equids is usually poor and impacts directly on their health, mental state and working capacity [<xref rid="B5-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This may seriously compromise the well-being of these animals and the families they work for. For this reason, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) recently decided to develop the first welfare standards for working equids used for traction, transport and income generation [<xref rid="B8-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, it is important to highlight that welfare problems, husbandry practices, and the role that these working animals play can vary between countries, through time, and even within the same community or locality [<xref rid="B5-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Consequently, appropriate intervention strategies to improve the welfare of these animals should be proposed and implemented according to, at least, two criteria: the main welfare problems found in the different geo-cultural contexts, and the assessment of the quality of the human&#x02013;animal relationship [<xref rid="B5-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The welfare status of working horses in Chile has been previously assessed [<xref rid="B9-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but the influence of geographic and cultural differences on these animals&#x02032; welfare is unknown. Differences within a country could modify the risk factors associated with the animals&#x02032; welfare. For example, heat stress and dehydration are conditions that negatively affect the welfare of equids in countries with arid climates, such as India or Pakistan, where ambient temperatures of up to 48 &#x000b0;C are found [<xref rid="B5-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, these problems have not been observed in countries that have internally varying climatic and geographic conditions, such as Chile. For example, the Metropolitana de Santiago region has the largest urban population in the country and is characterized by a warm, temperate climate with a prolonged dry season [<xref rid="B12-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In comparison, the Araucania region is one of the poorest regions and has the highest percentage of rural population. It is characterized by four types of climate, predominantly a rainy, temperate climate [<xref rid="B13-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, this region has the largest number of individuals belonging to the Mapuche group, an indigenous, ethnic population that preserves their ancient traditions [<xref rid="B14-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Strategies oriented to improve the welfare of animals, their owners and caretakers, also require an appropriate understanding of the human&#x02013;animal relationship and the multiple factors that modulate it [<xref rid="B15-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To form these strategies, the motivational considerations (bases) that underlie attitudes towards animals must be identified [<xref rid="B16-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], primarily the emotional or instrumental ways in which people relate to animals [<xref rid="B17-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Attitudes toward animals are often the focus of human&#x02013;animal interaction studies [<xref rid="B19-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and, more recently, of welfare studies [<xref rid="B23-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, most research on human&#x02013;horse relationships and the perceptions of horses has been centered in the equestrian world (horses that are kept primarily for recreational riding or competition) [<xref rid="B18-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B24-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and there is little information on working equids despite the important implications that this knowledge holds for improving these animals&#x02032; welfare. Moreover, welfare studies on working horses have not addressed the importance of owner&#x02032;s attitudes and perceptions on their interactions with their animals [<xref rid="B4-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B9-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. </p><p>Most studies that focus on the perception of horses have been limited to the use of traditional qualitative discourse analysis to determine the diverse perceptions and conceptions that people have in relation to these animals [<xref rid="B18-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B25-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. None of these studies have explored the representation of the meaning of words from other perspectives, such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). LSA is a mathematical tool that has been proposed by psychology researchers as a method for extracting and representing the meaning of words [<xref rid="B28-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] obtained in written texts, interviews or free text surveys [<xref rid="B29-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In contrast to traditional discourse analysis, LSA is an interesting tool for inferring much deeper relationships between words and results in better predictions of human judgments [<xref rid="B28-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Determining, through LSA, how owners or caregivers perceive their animals could reflect the nature of the owner&#x02013;horse interaction and the animals&#x02019; role in their lives. It could also infer the owner&#x02019;s motivation for improving the well-being of their horse.</p><p>Taking this into account, the aims of this study were, firstly, to assess and compare the welfare status of working horses in two different administrative regions of the country: one of which is closer to an ethnic-rural background (Araucania region) than the other (Metropolitana de Santiago region), and to determine whether any associations between direct and indirect welfare indicators exist. Secondly, we aimed to determine owners&#x02032; perceptions of their horses in both regions. </p></sec><sec id="sec2-animals-07-00056"><title>2. Materials and Methods </title><p>This study was carried out in peri-urban neighborhoods in two regions of Chile: the Metropolitana de Santiago region (33&#x000b0;26&#x02032;16&#x02033;S 70&#x000b0;39&#x02032;01&#x02033;O) and the Araucania region (38&#x000b0;54&#x02032;00&#x02033;S 72&#x000b0;40&#x02032;00&#x02033;O), between March of 2015 and January of 2016. The welfare assessment protocol was approved by the Animal Use and Care Ethical Committee of the School of Veterinary Sciences of the University of Chile (N&#x000b0; 06-2015). Owner participation was voluntary after signing an informed consent agreeing to participate in the study under the understanding that no economic benefit was involved. The owners were informed of all the aims of the study. </p><p>Due to a lack of information on the number of working horses in Chile, a convenience sample size was used. To localize owners and their horses, an electronic consultation with local municipalities was held to geographically locate the cities in Chile where a significant number of these horses were currently working. The researchers then visited the residences of the owners to invite them to participate in this study.</p><sec id="sec2dot1-animals-07-00056"><title>2.1. Welfare Assessment Protocol for Working Equines</title><p>A total of 100 urban draught horses (48 from the Metropolitana de Santiago region and 52 from the Araucania region) were assessed using a welfare assessment protocol for working equids, based on previously published literature [<xref rid="B4-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B9-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B31-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. When the owner had more than one horse, one horse per owner was randomly selected for the analysis. This protocol included a set of direct indicators, such as health parameters and behavioral observations, for assessing the general welfare status of horses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="animals-07-00056-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="animals-07-00056-t002">Table 2</xref>). In addition, indirect indicators, such as resource-based measures (the provision of food and water, management practices, etc.) were included (<xref ref-type="table" rid="animals-07-00056-t003">Table 3</xref>). Additional information about the general characteristics of the horses, such as age, sex, conformation type and estimated live weight, were also recorded. These indicators were evaluated at the owners&#x02019; households. First, the behavioral assessments were performed through direct observation. The health parameters were then assessed through clinical examination (direct indicators). Finally, each horse owner answered a specific questionnaire to obtain general characteristics of their horse, and the main resources and management that they received (indirect indicators). </p><sec id="sec2dot1dot1-animals-07-00056"><title>2.1.1. Direct Welfare Indicators</title><p>An assessment of horses&#x02019; health status and behavioral parameters was performed by an observer (a veterinarian) using a standardized protocol (<xref ref-type="table" rid="animals-07-00056-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="animals-07-00056-t002">Table 2</xref>). The presence and location of skin lesions were recorded, including lesions at the labial commissures of the mouth. A Body Condition Score (BCS) was recorded for each horse using a standard scoring scale from 1 (emaciated) to 5 (obese) [<xref rid="B32-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], including half scores [<xref rid="B6-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The assessment of hoof shape, conformation and quality was based on the criteria of Popescu et al. [<xref rid="B33-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and Burn et al. [<xref rid="B31-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="animals-07-00056-t001">Table 1</xref>). Hair coat and skin condition, including the presence of external ectoparasites, were assessed based on the criteria of Pritchard et al. [<xref rid="B5-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Gait abnormalities (lameness) were assessed and recorded by observing a horse walking in a straight line for approximately 20 m. The presence of lesions, hoof abnormalities, coat and skin conditions, and gait abnormalities were recorded as either present or absent, and adequate or inadequate, in terms of whether an indicator was altered or within the normal range. Body condition was recorded as a score and either adequate or inadequate (scores of 3, 3.5 and 4 were considered adequate, whereas scores of 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 4.5 and 5 were considered inadequate). The health parameters were also assessed in the same process as described previously.</p><p>Observations of horses&#x02032; general attitudes (alert, apathetic or depressed), horses&#x02032; responses to the approach of both the observer and the owner, horses&#x02032; responses to the observer and the owner walking down the animal&#x02032;s side (&#x0201c;walk-by&#x0201d;), and horse&#x02032;s responses to chin contact by the observer and the owner were made similarly, in accordance to the welfare assessment protocol as described by Popescu and Diugan [<xref rid="B4-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and Burn et al. [<xref rid="B31-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="animals-07-00056-t002">Table 2</xref>). In the approach and &#x0201c;walk-by tests&#x0201d;, each horse&#x02019;s response toward the observer and the owner was categorized as indifference, friendliness, avoidance or aggressiveness, based on the criteria of Popescu and Diugan [<xref rid="B4-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="animals-07-00056-t002">Table 2</xref>). The horse&#x02032;s response in the &#x0201c;chin contact test&#x0201d; was categorized as avoidance or acceptance based on the criteria of Burn et al. [<xref rid="B31-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="animals-07-00056-t002">Table 2</xref>). Finally, the &#x0201c;picking up a limb test&#x0201d; was also included in this study. Each horse&#x02032;s response towards the owner and the observer, when they picked up a limb, was recorded as either avoidance or acceptance. This was done in order to assess the response towards a common handling routine (cleaning of the hoof and shoeing). The behavioral tests were made first by the observer and then by the owner. Each horse&#x02032;s response was observed and recorded by the observer. The only procedure not made by the owner was that of general attitude (<xref ref-type="table" rid="animals-07-00056-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot2-animals-07-00056"><title>2.1.2.

Owners with more than one horse were asked to answer for the totality of their horses. This broad question gave owners the opportunity to express, in their own words, their subjective perception and point of view about how they conceive and conceptualize their working horse.

General Characteristics </title><p>The average age of the study population of working horses was 8.7 years (range = 2&#x02013;25; SD = 4.5 years). Sixty-one percent of horses were mares, 29% geldings, and 10% stallions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="animals-07-00056-t004">Table 4</xref>). Most horses (70%) had a speed type conformation according to their anamorphosic index and the average estimated live weight was 413 kg (range = 185&#x02013;632; SD = 82 kg). General characteristics of horses within each region are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="animals-07-00056-t004">Table 4</xref>.

No significant differences (Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.08) were found between regions in relation to the BCS of the horses. The main welfare problems found were hoof abnormalities (53%) and the presence of skin lesions (47%), which were mostly simple excoriations located on harness-related areas. Other less frequent problems found were inadequate skin or coat condition (14%), limb-associated abnormalities such as gait abnormality and lameness (13%), and lesions at the labial commissures of the mouth (3%). Significant differences between regions were found only in the presence of lesions: horses from the Metropolitana de Santiago region had a significantly higher (X<sup>2</sup> = 4.7; <italic>p</italic> = 0.03) frequency of skin lesions, primarily in the head and neck area (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0003).</p><p>The prevalence of behavioral responses displayed by the horses toward their owner and the observer for the five behavioral tests applied are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="animals-07-00056-t006">Table 6</xref>.

No significant differences (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) were found in a horse&#x02032;s responses towards their owner and the observer in the four behavioral tests. Regarding the differences between regions, there was a significantly higher (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) frequency of horses with friendly responses toward both the observer and the owner in the approach test and the walk-by test in the Araucania region in comparison to the Metropolitana de Santiago region (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="animals-07-00056-t006">Table 6</xref>).

The availability of water had no significant association (Fisher&#x02032;s exact test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.18) with the horses&#x02032; regions of origin. Most horses (83%) were fed twice or three times per day and almost all of them (90%) had access to drinking water throughout the entire day, as declared by the owner. Regarding equine healthcare, approximately half of the horses (49%) had been dewormed within the last 6 months. However, 17% of them had never received an antihelmintic drug and 42% of horses had never been examined by a veterinarian. In relation to shoeing practices, all owners declared that their horses were periodically shod, every 15, 16&#x02013;30 or more than 30 days (14%, 33% and 53% respectively). Within this sample, 48% were shod by the owner and 52% by a farrier. However, only 75% of horses were shod at the moment of inspection. Within the horses that were not shod (25%), 52% of them had a poor hoof quality. A significantly higher number of horses (75%) (<italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup> = 31.64; <italic>p</italic> = 0.000) were shod by owners in the Araucania region, while in the Metropolitana de Santiago region most horses (81%) were shod by a farrier. No significant difference (Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.51) was found in the frequency of shoeing. Most owners reported that their horses were used for transporting their families (52%) and for carrying diverse types of loads. The diversity of products transported varied depending on the region where they were located. In the Araucania region, horses were mainly used for carrying agricultural products (58%) and wood for construction and fuel (42%). In the Metropolitana de Santiago region, horses were used for transporting potting soil (27%), agricultural products for sale in markets (27%), and rubble (8%). The average frequency of use was 3.25 days per week (SD = 1.65; range = 1&#x02013;7) at an average of 3.87 hours per day (SD = 2.03; range = 1&#x02013;12).

Perceptions of Horses</title><p>Linguistic (semantic) analyses carried out showed that horse owners&#x02032; discourses were characterized by a high degree of subjectivity, with a high recurrence of terms such as &#x0201c;partner&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;like&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;friend&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;my life&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;all for me&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;family member&#x0201d; (e.g., &#x0201c;He is a family member, as a son&#x0201d;). Moreover, this subjectivity can be reflected in that all horses had a name given by the owner (e.g., Shakira or Gringo). In addition, 60% of the owners (63% from the Metropolitana de Santiago and 58% from the Araucania region) used possessive adjectives, such as "my horse is&#x02026;&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;they are my&#x02026;&#x0201d;, in their declarations.</p><p>Cluster analysis was used to identify related concepts or words according to their proximity in the owners&#x02032; answers. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="animals-07-00056-t007">Table 7</xref>, both groups of owners tended to conceptualize their horses as either a friend, a family member, part of the home and/or a working tool. Furthermore, they recognized psychological attributes in their horses, such as the capacity for understanding or loyalty, and stated that they like having a horse. Some differences were observed between regions; five out of nine of the word clusters from the Metropolitana de Santiago region identified concepts that reflected the willingness of owners to care for their animals (e.g., &#x0201c;feed them&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;take care of them&#x0201d;) and indicated that horses were perceived mainly as a source of recreation for their owners (e.g., &#x0201c;hobby&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;toy&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;pets&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;favorite&#x0201d;). On the other hand, most word clusters (seven) from Araucania region identified a wider range of concepts that reflected the use of animals as the owners&#x02032; main source of subsistence (e.g., &#x0201c;transport&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;food&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;we eat&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;source&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;bread&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;plough&#x0201d;).</p><p>A Semantic Correlation Analysis among the most frequently used words by horse owners of the Metropolitana de Santiago region revealed a significant and very high correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 1.00; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) between the following terms: &#x0201c;family&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;house&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;favorite&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;pet&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;distracts&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;take care of them&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;feed them&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;pet&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;favorite&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;feed them&#x0201d;.

This may be the result of labor demands by their owners and their relationship with people and their environment [<xref rid="B41-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Additionally, welfare status may be affected by individualities (i.e., personality).</p><p>In this study, most owners showed a preference for using mares (61%), differing from previous studies where geldings were more frequent [<xref rid="B9-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This could be due to owners&#x02032; considering the reproduction of their animals as an extra source of income through the sale of the offspring or as an asset, by keeping the newborns as replacement. Lanas et al. [<xref rid="B11-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported a similar preference for mares in peri-urban areas of central and southern Chile.</p><p>Age is an important factor that may affect the welfare of working equids. McLeod [<xref rid="B42-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] suggests that horses work better between 4&#x02013;12 years of age. This is because horses reach their zootechnical maturity at approximately 4 years of age. In comparison, after 12 years of age, work, efficiency progressively decreases [<xref rid="B42-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The average age of horses in this study was 8.7 years, which is similar to findings for other areas of Chile [<xref rid="B9-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B42-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In addition, the majority of the horses (68%) included in this study were within the optimum age range, which as S&#x000e1;ez et al. [<xref rid="B10-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] pointed out, has positive implications for the welfare of these animals.</p><p>A small percentage of horses examined in this study (17%) had an inadequate BCS, similar to the findings of Tadich et al. [<xref rid="B9-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] in urban draught horses in southern Chile and contrary to those reported by Pritchard et al. [<xref rid="B5-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], where the majority of working horses (70%) in Middle East and Central Asia had a BCS of 2 or less. It has been described that a low BCS can be caused by multiple factors, such as malnutrition, overwork, parasitism and diseases [<xref rid="B7-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, in this study, the only factor significantly associated with a poor BCS was the absence of deworming practices, found in 17% of all horses. Therefore, educational programs for owners focusing on good husbandry and healthcare practices should be implemented, with the purpose of improving owners&#x02032; understanding on how these practices can potentially affect the health and well-being of their animals.</p><p>Lameness, hoof abnormalities and poor hoof care are problems widely reported in working equines [<xref rid="B6-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B9-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], mostly in urban or peri-urban areas [<xref rid="B44-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In this study, hoof abnormalities were the most frequent problem, with no differences between the administrative regions studied. The majority of horses included in this study (53%) were shod infrequently, at intervals longer than 30 days. Additionally, there was a significant association between hoof abnormalities and shoeing intervals higher than 30 days. This low frequency of shoeing could be attributed to the lack of knowledge of owners about hoof balance and care and the lack of availability and accessibility of the service, taking into account the economic constraints of this population [<xref rid="B3-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B45-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Furthermore, there was no association between adequate hoof conformation and horses being shod by a farrier, which may indicate deficiencies in farrier knowledge and skills, probably due to a lack of farrier training courses in the country [<xref rid="B9-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, farrier training courses on hoof care, aimed at local farriers and owners, should be implemented to increase horse owner awareness of the negative consequences that hoof abnormalities can bring for their animals&#x02032; welfare. This could be organized by local government agencies or non-governmental organizations in Chile.</p><p>Skin lesions have been reported as one of the most common afflictions found in working equids worldwide [<xref rid="B5-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B9-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B38-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In this study, skin lesions were the second most frequently observed problem, especially in the Metropolitana de Santiago region. Most of these were simple excoriations, located mainly on harness related areas and in concordance with the patterns reported by other studies [<xref rid="B9-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B44-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In our study, skin lesions tended to be associated with poor body condition, whereas age (individuals over 15 years of age) was not significantly associated with the presence of lesions, contrary to the findings of Burn et al. [<xref rid="B6-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Likewise, the presence of skin lesions was not associated with an inadequate conformation of horses for draught activities (based on their AI and work frequency). Thus, other factors, probably extrinsic to the animal, could be associated with the occurrence of skin lesions, for example, ill-fitting harnesses, poor maintenance of equipment, or overload, all of which have been previously related to skin lesions in working equids [<xref rid="B4-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B9-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Behavioral tests are considered an essential component in the welfare assessment of working equids. These tests indicate, to some extent, how the animal interacts with its environment [<xref rid="B5-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and can help to understand the quality of the human&#x02013;equid relationship [<xref rid="B7-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The high prevalence of an alert attitude and of positive (friendly) responses towards both the owner and the observer, in all tests in the two administrative regions evaluated, indicates the existence of a good human&#x02013;animal relationship between owners and their animals and an appropriate handling of horses by owners. These results differ from previous studies, in which indifference, aggressiveness and avoidance were the most prevalent behaviors observed in working equids [<xref rid="B4-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Several studies in the livestock industry have provided evidence on the relationship between the attitudes of a stockperson towards the animals and their behavioral responses and welfare [<xref rid="B23-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B46-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. For example, Hemsworth et al. [<xref rid="B47-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] found that positive attitudes toward animals were associated with more positive interactions and that these positive interactions were negatively associated with the animals&#x02032; fear towards humans. Therefore, it could be possible that the owners assessed in this study have more positive attitudes towards their animals, which may be reflected in the high prevalence of the positive responses found. The discourse analysis of statements made by owners, focusing on how they conceptualize and describe their horses, showed similarities and differences, depending on the geographical location of their owners. Owners of both regions generally tended to see their animals as subjective individuals, capable of occupying a place in their lives as either a member of the family or as a friend. This indicates an affective relationship between the owners and their horses. Owners also conferred their animals&#x02019; mental abilities similar to those of humans (e.g., &#x0201c;He is the only one who understands me&#x0201d;), which can be interpreted as a clear tendency to anthropomorphize the behavior of their animals [<xref rid="B48-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, the recognition of these animals as a work tool (instrumental role) was also present in the discourse of owners, especially in owners from the Araucania region (e.g., &#x0201c;He is the one that provides my everyday bread, the food, my work tool&#x0201d;).</p><p>Generally, the emotionality (affection for animals) and instrumentality (e.g., economic or utilitarian considerations) with which animals are perceived are often seen as opposite to each other [<xref rid="B17-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this sense, the emotional aspect of the human&#x02013;animal relationship has often been linked to the keeping of companion animals [<xref rid="B49-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], whereas keeping farm animals has been mainly associated to financial or utilitarian purposes, especially in the poorest communities worldwide. However, the results from this study suggest that affective and instrumental perceptions can coexist. Coincidentally, Schuurman [<xref rid="B18-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] showed that conceptions of horses, particularly of equine welfare, consist of a combination of emotional and instrumental relations. Other authors have also reported that instrumental and affective components within livestock production can, and do, co-exist. In other words, animals can be thought of as simultaneously a friend and source of food [<xref rid="B50-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>How people relate to animals cannot be isolated from the cultural contexts in which they are embedded [<xref rid="B51-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In the Metropolitana de Santiago region, owners&#x02032; descriptions of their horses indicated predominantly affective-type ascriptions. Based on a correlations analysis, the results indicate that the owners of this region showed a certain predilection for this species and tend to perceive their horse, primarily, as a pet, even in some cases as a friend. Moreover, they recognized certain needs of their animals and demonstrated a clear intention in taking care of them (e.g., &#x0201c;They are my favorite pets, I like to feed them well&#x0201d;), most likely to keep their animals as healthy as possible. This could be interpreted as the owners having an empathetic understanding of their horses as individuals (in some cases, they are considered companion animals or pets) that feel and have needs. In the Araucania region, owners&#x02032; discourse emphasized the perception of their horse as a family member. This indicates, based on the LSA results, that there may be an affective owner&#x02013;horse relationship, due to the owners&#x02032; perception of kinship and closeness with their animals. The owner&#x02032;s discourse also highlighted the instrumental role that their horse plays for the family&#x02032;s subsistence, exalting a feeling of gratitude towards the animal&#x02032;s labor. One possible explanation for this ambivalence could be that owners from the Araucania region are closer to an ethnic-rural background than those from the Metropolitana de Santiago region. The Mapuche ethnicity, which is concentrated in the Araucania region [<xref rid="B14-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], has been characterized as a culture that historically conceived the horse (a species introduced by the Spanish) as an animal of burden and transport [<xref rid="B52-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Therefore, it might be expected that these owners have acquired a utilitarian vision of these animals through family and cultural inheritance. On the other hand, owners from the Metropolitana de Santiago region do not see the horse exclusively as a working instrument but also as a companion animal. In fact, results of the LSA suggest that there is predilection towards horses, rather than a sense of labor in keeping these animals, and that owners from this region also recognize human psychological characteristics in their animals.</p><p>It is important to note that most owners stated that they enjoyed keeping these animals, which could indicate that many of them chose this occupation voluntarily, rather than simply continuing a family activity. These perceptions, added to the good welfare status found in most of the horses evaluated in the study, illustrate that working horse owners in Chile, generally, do not mistreat or exploit their animals.</p><p>This study may be limited by owners&#x02032; bias when asked about perceptions regarding their horses. Survey respondents may have tried to anticipate what they thought researchers wished to hear. This is especially likely to occur within this population, considering that working horses are constantly in the public eye [<xref rid="B53-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-animals-07-00056" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Given that an owner&#x02032;s appreciation of his/her horse(s) was determined through only one question, future studies could include the use of validated attachment scales and attitudes towards animals.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-animals-07-00056"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The low prevalence of health problems and negative behavior responses found in horses of the two administrative regions evaluated indicate a good welfare status for the majority of horses in this study. The main problems observed in the assessed animals were hoof abnormalities and skin lesions. A possible explanation for these observations is a lack of understanding of basic husbandry practices, which may be improved through the implementation of educational programs for owners and local farriers. There were significant differences between the two regions in the presence of lesions on horses and the person responsible for shoeing management. This study provides preliminary information about owners&#x02032; relationships with their animals and both affective and instrumental perceptions of working horses were observed. While the instrumental perception was more common in the Araucania region, the affective perception was widely shared by both groups of owners. This indicates that working horses are considered part of the family or a friend and suggests an affective relationship of owners with their animals.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by CONICYT National Doctorate Fellowship (NO. 21130091), and FONDECYT 11121467 and FONDECYT 1161136.
