New therapeutic approaches are urgently needed in order to improve survival and response rates of GBC patients.

It has a high morbidity and poor prognosis as it is often associated with early metastasis and invasiveness [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. GBC tumors affect thousands of individuals worldwide (annual incidence of 2.2/100,000), but has a much higher impact and mortality in Chile, China, Japan and India [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Complete surgical resection is the only potentially curative approach in early stages of the disease. However, most patients cannot undergo surgery since GBC is usually diagnosed at much more advanced stages [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Chemotherapy has been the main treatment option in circumscribed, advanced or metastatic biliary-tract carcinoma. A combination of chemotherapy with gemcitabine and a platinum-based agent is regarded as the standard treatment for patients with advanced biliary-tract cancer. However, the response to standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy is extremely poor, with modest impact on overall survival [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, new therapeutic options are needed to improve survival and response rates. Understanding the signaling pathways in GBC, such as Hedgehog, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Notch, ErbB, MAPK and angiogenesis, holds great promise for the development of new effective treatment strategies [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>High-troughput, rapid small molecule inhibitor screenings to identify therapeutic targets for cancer become tractable with the development of new technologies [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This method has been used so far to screen compounds for treating a number of heamatological malignancies [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We employed the same method to screen 130 potential treatment drugs in gallbladder cancer cell lines and identified a set of small molecule inhibitors including 17AAG, Velcade, Volasartib and YM-155 as the most potent growth inhibitors of these cell lines. We subsequently tested the HSP90 inhibitor 17AAG in pre-clinical cancer models.</p><p>HSP90 is a ubiquitous ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that facilitates the maturation of more than 200 downstream proteins, including key mediators of signal transduction, cell-cycle control and transcriptional regulation [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. HSP90 also stabilizes numerous oncoproteins that facilitate malignant progression and maintain transformed cellular phenotypes as well as enables tumor cells to escape apoptotic death [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Its deregulation has been associated with the pathogenesis of various human cancers [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The use of inhibitors against HSP90 has been proposed as an attractive therapeutic strategy in numerous tumors based on the fact that HSP90 clients comprise proteins that contribute to all of the six hallmarks of cancer Therefore, its inhibition could simultaneously interfere with key pathophysiological processes of tumor cells, leading to more effective clinical results [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Geldanamycin (GA), a benzoquinone ansamycin antibiotic isolated from <italic>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</italic>, is a first generation HSP90 inhibitor with potent anti-tumor effects <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, it was never evaluated in clinical trials mainly due to metabolic instability, limited solubility, and induction of severe hepatotoxicity in animals [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. 17-AAG (Tanespimycin), an analog molecule chemically derived from GA, was the first HSP90 inhibitor to enter clinical trials [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In preclinicals models it has shown antitumor activity in various types of cancer, such as colon, breast, ovarian, and melanoma tumors [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In this study we systematically screened 130 small molecule for gallbladder cancer inhibition. We evaluated antitumoral activity of HSP90 inhibitors, 17-AAG and geldanamycin, <italic>in vitro</italic> and on a preclinical subcutaneous tumor model and showed the potential of the 17-AAG for further clinical investigations.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Small molecule inhibitors with therapeutic potential for GBC</title><p>Based on previous publications by the co-authors of this study about the methodology high-throughput rapid small molecule inhibitor screening [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], we pre-selected drugs from the FDA approved list of anti-cancer kinase and other small molecule inhibitors that were computationally and genetically (siRNA screening) tested in series of cancer cell lines. We adopted 130 drugs taking cue from those previous studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In the rapid screen of these 130 drugs, we identified small molecules inhibitors including 17-AAG (Tanespimycin), Eleslomol, Velcade, Volasartib and YM-155 as the five most potent drugs across GBC cell lines. (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Most of these drugs are either in clinical trials or have been determined to be effective against a wide range of cancers in preclinical tests. However, these molecules have not been investigated for their efficacy in GBC. It is important to note that all the seven GBC cell lines showed resistance against a series of widely used antitumoral drugs included in the screen. The IC<sub>50</sub> values for the seven GBC cell lines of the drugs tested is provided in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. These drugs are known to target many different kinases and receptors and have proved effective in other types of cancer. The results corroborate with the lack of effective chemotherapy-based treatment for GBC. Notably, five of them proved to be potent against the seven GBC cell lines investigated. Among these five candidates, we selected the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG (Tanespimycin) for pre-clinical validation as a potential therapeutic molecule for GBC.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Top five most potent drugs for gallbladder cancer</title><p>Seven human gallbladder cancer cell lines GB-d1, G415, SNU308, NOZ, TGBC1TKB, TGBC2TKB and TGBC24TKB were used for the rapid small molecule inhibitor screen including a panel of 130 small molecule inhibitors.

Through the same approach we screened 130 small molecule inhibitors for GBC, which has allowed us to identify many promising compounds/drugs for using against GBC, such as, 17-AAG, Velcade, Volasertib and YM-155. As 17-AAG is a multi-target drug that acts on a diverse set of regulatory pathways [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], we decided to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of this HSP90 inhibitor and its analog geldanamycin, <italic>in vitro</italic> and in preclinical models of human GBC in NOD-SCID mice. We also evaluated the expression of HSP90 by immunohistochemistry in GBC tumors.</p><p>HSP90 is a chaperone protein involved in the stabilization and conformational maturation of numerous oncoproteins [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Many studies have demonstrated that HSP90 is associated with the pathogenesis, poor prognosis and resistance to therapy of various human cancers [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. HSP90 target proteins are known to contribute to nearly every aspect of the oncogenic process including immortality, survival, anti-apoptosis, genomic instability, neoangiogenesis and metastasis [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Inhibition of HSP90 through blockade of ATP-binding sites of the HSP90-partner complex results in the dephosphorylation and/or the proteasomal degradation of these target proteins and leads to potent antitumor activity [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of HSP90 inhibitors on <italic>in vitro</italic> models and its suppression of tumor growth in numerous solid tumors in human subcutaneous growing xenografts [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, no studies have reported the use of HSP90 inhibitors on <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> GBC models. Although currently no HSP90-targeting agents have been approved for human use, several clinical trials have shown their antitumor activity, alone or in combination with other cytotoxic agents, in multiple tumor types [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. 17-AAG (Tanespimycin) is the first HSP90 inhibitor that has been investigated in phase II clinical trials in patients with thyroid, pancreatic or kidney cancer [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and with promising results in patients with metastatic breast cancer [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>New water-soluble analogs of 17-AAG, such as 17-DMAG (Alvespimycin) and IPI-504 (Retaspimycin) have proved to have a longer half-life in plasma, greater oral bioavailability, superior antitumor activity in preclinical studies and lower toxicity compared with 17-AAG [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the past years there has been a considerable increase in the discovery of HSP90 inhibitors, progressing from first-generation derivatives of natural products to second and third-generation fully synthetic small molecules with improved pharmacokinetic profiles [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Even though HSP90 is widely expressed in normal tissues, HSP90 inhibitors selectively kill cancer cells but not normal ones due to the fact that HSP90 in tumor cells is mostly in its active conformation as part of multi-chaperone complexes that have 100-fold greater binding affinity for 17-AAG compared to the uncomplexed, latent form of HSP90 that is present in normal cells [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Currently 17-AAG is not under clinical study, but other HSP90 inhibitors, with even better pharmacological and toxicological properties, such as retaspimycin HCL, NVP-AUY922, NVP-BEP800, CNF2024/BIIB021, SNX-5422, STA-9090, are currently under investigation [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. STA-9090 (Ganetespib), having improved pharmacologic properties in terms of potency, safety, and tolerability compared with other first- and second generation HSP90 inhibitors, has reached phase III clinical trial and currently 12 clinical trials are underway (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov">https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>).</p><p>The induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis are common mechanisms proposed for the antiproliferative effect of 17-AAG on cancer cells [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Similar to what has been observed in other tumoral cells treated with HSP90 inhibitors [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], our studies showed that 17-AAG and GA decreased cell viability and cell migration in GBC cells and these effects were strongly associated with a marked decrease of HSP90 target proteins such as EGFR, AKT, phospho-AKT, phospho-ERK, cyclin D1 and cyclin B1. Also, in concordance to other studies, we observed a marked increase in expression of HSP90 after 17-AAG or GA treatment, likely through activation of the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), the master stress-inducible regulator, in the cytoplasm and the nucleus [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], or by disrupting nuclear HSP90/multichaperone complexes that inhibit activation of DNA-bound HSF1 [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Molecular changes observed in our study were consistent with the increased G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis observed in our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. It is widely known that ERK1/2, Cyclin B1 and Cyclin D1 are implicated in the regulation of the G2/M phase transition and are required for mitosis to occur normally [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It has also been demonstrated that blockade of EGFR results in a significant inhibition of the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> growth of several cell lines derived from human carcinomas of various histological types [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In a cohort of 49 samples from patients with advanced biliary tract carcinomas (BTC), 13 of which corresponded to GBC, Pignochino <italic>et al</italic>., showed that EGFR was expressed in 38.5% of GBC cases, and phospho-MAPK and phospho-AKT were expressed in &#x0003c; 46% of these cases, indicating the activation of the EGFR pathway [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. They also demonstrated that blocking EGFR/HER2 signaling resulted in considerable antiproliferative effects on <italic>in vitro</italic> models of BTC. It was also shown that targeting EGFR/HER2 pathways enhances the antiproliferative effect of gemcitabine in biliary tract and gallbladder carcinomas [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Inhibition of HSP90 target proteins such as AKT and phospho-AKT, which are frequently active or overexpressed in many cancer cells, including GBC, affect the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway which plays an important role in regulating cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cell survival [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Considering HSP90 interactions with a number of oncogenic proteins, the observed overall effect of GA and 17-AAG on the studied GBC cell lines depends on the additive effect of all these proteins [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This could explain that although we observed an increased expression of Cyclin B1 in G-415 cells after treatments either with GA or 17-AAG, this did not affect the inhibitory effect on proliferation and cell migration in this cell line. Interestingly, Gazitt <italic>et al</italic>., also reported that treatment with 17-AAG caused an upregulation of Cyclin B1 in osteosarcoma cell lines, and association of this phenomenon with mitotic blockage [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Our <italic>in vivo</italic> study demonstrated for the first time the therapeutic efficacy of a HSP90 inhibitor in GBC xenografts. The significant tumor mass reduction observed in 17-AAG-treated mice was associated with a marked decrease in phosphorylation of AKT. This is especially relevant, considering that previous studies by our group have shown upregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in advanced GBC [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It is widely known that AKT protects cells from apoptosis by phosphorylating and inactivating several key apoptotic molecules [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Dephosphorylation and inactivation of AKT increases sensitivity of the cells to apoptosis-inducing stimulus [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Several studies have shown that 17-AAG sensitizes tumor cells to taxol-induced apoptosis [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and synergizes with cisplatin inducing apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. 17-AAG also sensitizes radioresistant cells to radiation by inhibiting the PI3K-Akt pathway [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Arlander <italic>et al</italic>., reported that 17-AAG-mediated disruption of Chk1 activation drastically sensitized various tumor cells to gemcitabine, which is, in combination with platinum-based agents, the standard treatment for patients with advanced biliary-tract cancer [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>Previously, our group have demonstrated that rapamycin exert strong therapeutic efficacy on subcutaneous xenograft tumors of human GBC [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Also, Ding <italic>et al</italic>., showed that the combination of rapamycin, Cl-1040 and 17-AAG reduced circulating prostate cancer cells in a mouse model for circulating prostate cancer DNA quantification [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. These findings suggest that the combination of rapamycin and 17-AAG could be a strategy that should be considered for future studies.</p><p>Unlike <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, no expression changes in other proteins were observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. This could be explained by the dose regimen used in the treated mice, which was the dose tolerated for the animals, but clearly was not sufficient to affect most of the evaluated HSP90 target proteins from tumor samples. To optimize the <italic>in vivo</italic> dosing regimen and to reach a suitable efficacy-tolerability balance may require the use of other HSP90 inhibitors with even better pharmacological and toxicological properties, such as 17-DMAG, which is a water soluble analog of 17-AAG, or second or third generation HSP90 inhibitors [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Also, more studies should be conducted to determine whether other proteins or pathways are affected by 17-AAG in GBC models.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings provide a rationale for the potential use of HSP90 inhibitors as a novel, highly effective therapeutic strategy for GBC treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Seven human GBC cell lines GB-d1, G-415, SNU308, NOZ, TGBC1TKB, TGBC2TKB and TGBC24TKB were used for the rapid small molecule inhibitor screening.

Caspase 3/7 (+)/Sytox (&#x02212;) and caspase 3/7 (+)/Sytox (+) also were counted and considered as total apoptotic cells. Experiments were performed in three technical replicates and a total of 10,000 cells were analyzed in each individual experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4_11"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> tumor xenograft assays</title><p>8 to 12-week-old NOD-SCID mice (obtained from Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, USA) were subcutaneously injected in one flank with 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells of G-415 resuspended in 200 &#x003bc;l of PBS with 30% of Matrigel (Matrigel&#x02122; Basement Membrane Matrix, BD Biosciences). When the average tumor reached 50 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were randomly separated into two groups and treated with 17-AAG and its respective vehicle. 17-AAG was administered at a daily intraperitoneal (i.p) dose of 25 mg/kg for 5 days per week for 4 weeks. Tumor volumes were estimated twice a week from caliper measurements (volume = 0.52 &#x000d7; (width)<sup>2</sup> &#x000d7; length).</p></sec><sec id="s4_12"><title>HSP90 immunohistochemical staining</title><p>Whole tissue sections (WTSs) and tissue microarrays (TMAs) were used for this study. Three different representatives areas were sampled for TMAs construction according to previously published methods [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. None of these patients had received preoperative chemotherapy. HSP90 expression was evaluated using a previously described immunohistochemistry protocol [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Briefly, heat induced antigen retrieval was performed prior to immunohistochemical staining. Sections were incubated with a HSP90 monoclonal antibody (1:200 dilution, Novocastra Laboratories) at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. Detection of signal was achieved using the LSAB + kit (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 3,3&#x02032;-diaminobenzidine/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (DAKO) was used as chromogen and slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. We used gastric cancer tissue as positive control and omission of the primary antibody was used as a negative control. The immunohistochemical staining of HSP90 was examined by two independent and specialized pathologists (JRV, AHC) without any information about clinicopathological features or prognosis. Immunohistochemical staining was evaluated based on staining intensity and positive cells within the whole tissue section using a previously described scoring system [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Briefly, an arbitrary 20% cutoff was used to determine HSP90 positivity. Only cytoplasmic staining was considered positive for HSP90, and expression was graded visually as negative, weak or moderate/strong [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4_13"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Use of gallbladder specimens from patients was approved by the IRB of the School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Cat&#x000f3;lica de Chile.
