It is caused by a heterozygous deletion of 1.5&#x02013;3&#x02009;Mb on chromosome region 22q11.2. Patients with the deletion present features that include neuropsychiatric problems, craniofacial abnormalities and cardiovascular malformations. However, the phenotype is highly variable and the factors related to the clinical heterogeneity are not fully understood. About 65% of patients with 22q11.2DS have congenital heart defects (CHD). The main goal of this study was to identify common CNVs in 22q11.2DS patients that could be associated with the incomplete penetrance of CHD. Analysis of genomic DNA from 253 patients with 22q11.2DS using array technology showed an association between a microduplication located in region 17q21.31 and CHD (p-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.023, OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.75, 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.17&#x02013;7.03). This region includes the first three exons of <italic>KANSL1</italic> gene. Bioinformatic analysis showed that <italic>KANSL1</italic> and <italic>CRKL</italic>, a gene in the commonly deleted region of 22q11.2DS, are part of the same regulatory module in a miRNA-mRNA network. These results show that a <italic>KANSL1</italic> microduplication, in combination with the 22q11.2 deletion, is associated with increased risk of CHD in these patients, suggesting that <italic>KANSL1</italic> plays a role as a modifier gene in 22q11.2DS patients.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS, OMIM #192430, #188400) is the most common microdeletion syndrome in humans and is associated with a wide variety of phenotypic features, including congenital heart defects (CHD), craniofacial anomalies, intellectual disability, increased risk of psychosis and schizophrenia, among others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Ninety percent of the patients have a ~3&#x02009;Mb hemizygous deletion and less than 10% of patients have a smaller 1.5 or 2&#x02009;Mb deletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Interestingly, different deletion sizes have no apparent effects in disease severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In addition, the phenotype is highly variable even within the patients who share the same 3&#x02009;Mb deletion. This heterogeneity may involve a genetic component such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or copy number variations (CNVs), which could be affecting modifier genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. CNVs are known contributors to complex diseases including CHD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, being potential modifiers for several different diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p>Little is known about genetic modifiers that may influence the clinical variability observed in patients with 22q11.2DS. Putative modifier genes have been identified in mouse models and include <italic>FGF8</italic>, <italic>FGF10</italic>, <italic>GBX2</italic>, <italic>PITX2</italic>, <italic>CRKL</italic>, <italic>VEGF</italic>, <italic>TGF&#x003b2;</italic>, <italic>CHRD</italic> and <italic>SHH</italic> (reviewed in Aggarwal <italic>et al</italic>.)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, but their role in humans with 22q11.2DS has not been established. To date, only three studies have performed genome-wide search strategies for modifiers of CHD in 22q11.2DS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In these studies, 22q11.2DS patients with and without structural heart defects were compared.</p><p>In the first study, Mlynarski <italic>et al</italic>. performed a genome-wide association study using microarray technology. The study used probe-intensity information from microarray plus bioinformatics processing to identify CNVs, finding a statistically significant association between a duplication encompassing the <italic>SLC2A3</italic> gene and CHD phenotype in 22q11.2DS patients (p-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.68&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.08 [95% confidence interval 2.0&#x02013;17.51]). The authors show that the <italic>SLC2A3</italic> duplication by itself is not pathogenic unless it is inherited in combination with 22q11.2 deletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Moreover, functional studies in mice show that <italic>SLC2A3</italic> gene is a genetic modifier of the cardiac phenotype. The <italic>SLC2A3</italic> gene, also known as <italic>GLUT3</italic>, encodes a glucose transporter, which is important in tissues with high energy demands and metabolic rates, as cardiac myocytes and brain, among others.</p><p>The second study performed whole exome sequencing in 184 patients with 22q11.2DS, finding enrichment for rare deleterious SNVs in <italic>MINA</italic>, <italic>RREB1, KDM7A</italic> and <italic>JMJDC1</italic> genes in the CHD group compared to the non-CHD group. These genes code for proteins related to epigenetic regulation that activates transcription by demethylation of histones, mainly H3K9 and H3K27. The results of this study suggest that variants in histone modification genes increase the risk of CHD in the presence of deletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p>The third study analyzed rare CNVs using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 technology. The authors demonstrated no significant difference in overall burden of rare CNVs in patients with CHD compared to controls. However, an enrichment of CNVs overlapping with protein-coding cardiac-related genes was found in 22q11.2DS individuals with heart defects (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;607) compared to normal hearts (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;339). Furthermore, network analysis revealed that CNVs in specific cardiac networks, such as Wnt signaling, were overrepresented in 22q11.2DS CHD cases but not in 22q11DS, controls suggesting that specific CNVs located outside of the 22q11.2 region may increase the risk for CHDs in some 22q11DS patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p>Although these genes were identified as genetic modifiers of CHD phenotype, they explain only a small proportion of the incomplete penetrance of CHDs in 22q11.2DS patients, suggesting that other modifiers of this condition exist. To search for new genetic modifiers and to address the effect of CNVs in a Chilean cohort of patients with 22q11.2DS, a genome-wide search was performed using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays (Santa Clara, CA). First, the overall burden of CNVs in 22q11.2DS patients with and without CHD was compared, including absolute CNV counts and genomic length, and then proceeded to perform association analysis between CHD phenotype and CNVs. To minimize false positives, a combination of PennCNV for CNV detection and ParseCNV for association study, followed by a validation of the CNVs with a second independent technique was chosen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Results indicated that a microduplication in the first three exons of KAT8 Regulatory NSL Complex Subunit 1 gene (<italic>KANSL1</italic>) is associated with CHD. Finally, a network integrative analysis approach was performed with computational biology tools to identify a biological interaction between <italic>KANSL1</italic> gene and genes within 22q11.2 deletion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A genome-wide analysis using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays in cohort one was performed, corresponding to 253 patients with 22q11.2DS. After stringent filter criteria detailed in Methods, 39 samples were excluded from the analysis (28 with CHD, 11 without): 29 for Log R Ratio (LRR) standard deviation greater than 0.45, four for quality control in wave adjustment and six for having over 100 CNV counts. In summary, 214 samples from unrelated subjects with 22q11.2DS (105 CHD and 109 without CHD) passed quality controls. The association between 22q11.2 deletion size and CHD phenotype was first assessed. There were 195 patients (91%) with a 3&#x02009;Mb deletion (97 CHD and 98 No-CHD), 6 patients (2.8%) with 2&#x02009;Mb (3 CHD and 3 No-CHD), and 13 (6.1%) with 1.5&#x02009;Mb deletion (5 CHD and 8 No-CHD) (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.63, p-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.73), showing no association between deletion size and CHD phenotype, consistent with previous publications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>CNV analysis</title><p>There were no statistically significant differences in global CNV burden between CHD and no-CHD groups. Global CNV burden measures included average CNV length (2.7&#x02009;Mb for CHD group vs. 2.6&#x02009;Mb for no-CHD group) and average total number of CNVs per individual (18 for CHD group vs. 19 for no-CHD group). The same analysis was performed comparing only deletions between CHD and no-CHD groups and then comparing only duplications. No statistically significant differences were observed in this analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Total CNV burden in 22q11.2DS patients.

</p><p>Then, the statistical association of CNVs with the cardiac condition was assessed by using the overlapping regions method with the ParseCNV pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. None of the CNVs reached the uncorrected p-value that met conservative multiple-testing significance of association (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Therefore, the top-ranked CNVs obtained by this method with an uncorrected cutoff of p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 were selected, in search of biologically plausible associations.

Only one patient had both traits, the duplication of the <italic>KANSL1</italic> gene and CHD (p value&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.85, CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.015&#x02013;10.37).

This kit contains probes for all 15 exons of the <italic>KANSL1</italic> gene. The analysis of the samples showed that the duplication includes at least exons 1, 2 and 3 of the <italic>KANSL1</italic> gene. Nevertheless, the design of MLPA probes does not allow to define the exact breakpoints of the duplication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Biological interactions networks</title><p>If <italic>KANSL1</italic> is a modifier of CHD in 22q11.2DS patients, there must be a biological relationship with genes located in the 22q11.2 deletion region. To examine this hypothesis, a series of bioinformatic tools related to biological networks were used. Importantly, to be more stringent, only data with experimentally-validated biological interactions were considered.</p><p>As a first approach, an analysis was conducted to determine existing protein-protein interaction between KANSL1 and protein-coding genes located in 22q11.2 deletion using GeneMANIA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. This tool showed no direct interactions between KANSL1 and protein-coding genes located in 22q11.2 deletion. Therefore, a second approach included the search for regulatory interactions, and a miRNA-mRNA network was constructed. <italic>KANSL1</italic> and the 46 protein coding genes in the 22q11.2 deletion region were used as input in miRWalk database to identify miRNAs that regulate these genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. A miRNA-mRNA network was constructed using mRNA as the target node and the corresponding miRNA/s pairs found in the miRWalk database as the source node. This analysis showed that <italic>KANSL1</italic> is regulated by miR-106b-5p, miR-148a-3p, miR-23b-3p, miR-17-5p, miR-149-5p and miR-130b-3p. These miRNAs also regulate <italic>DGCR14, DGCR2, TXNRD2, MRPL40</italic> and <italic>CRKL</italic> genes, which are included in the 22q11.2 deletion. Moreover, in a second miRNA-mRNA network analysis, previously reported modifier genes (<italic>MINA</italic>, <italic>RREB1</italic>, <italic>KDM7A</italic> and <italic>JMJDC1</italic> and <italic>SLC2A3</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> were also included. Interestingly, <italic>SLC2A3</italic> and <italic>RREB1</italic> genes, which are not included in 22q11.2 deletion, are regulated by the same miRNAs that regulate <italic>KANSL1</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). To assess whether these results could occur by chance, the analyses was repeated using 50 random genes in network constructions.

Results showed that a microduplication that contains at least the first 3 exons of the <italic>KANSL1</italic> gene is statistically associated with the presence of CHD in 22q11.2DS patients and biologically related with modifier genes and genes located in 22q11.2 deletion region. Even though statistical association did not reach the multiple hypothesis testing correction, the integration of the top ranked p-values with interaction data gives a robust combination of the results in a biological context. Moreover, other studies have shown that even when a non-statistically significant p-value is obtained, the use of biological networks gives important information related to the condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p>Findings show that <italic>KANSL1</italic> duplication is a common CNV, seen in approximately 12% of a large group of Chilean individuals, indicative that by itself it is frequent and benign, but that in combination with 22q11.2 deletion, it increases the risk of CHD.</p><p>KANSL1 is a protein-coding gene that belongs to a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex. This gene is encoded by KAT8, modifies the acetylation state of histone H4, mainly H4K16, and plays a role in the control of gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Haploinsufficiency of this gene is implicated in Koolen-De Vries syndrome (KDVS, OMIM #610443)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Interestingly, 39% of KDVS patients have CHD, mainly atrial septal defects or ventricular septal defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Analysis of the 17q21.31 region and characterization of KDVS patients without deletion of 17q21.31 show that SNVs located in <italic>KANSL1</italic> genes can be the cause of this syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Moreover, one of every four patients with point mutations in <italic>KANSL1</italic> has CHD, suggesting that this is a CHD-related gene, although further functional studies are needed to confirm this link<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p>CNVs in <italic>KANSL1</italic> may be associated with CHD, with deletions causing KDVS and duplications acting as modifiers of the cardiovascular phenotype in 22q11.2DS. The literature reports show the effect of duplications in <italic>KANSL1</italic> gene in individuals with development delay, microcephaly and mild dysmorphic features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. These duplications span at least the complete <italic>KANSL1</italic> sequence and the microtubule-associated protein Tau gene (<italic>MAPT</italic>), which differs from the partial duplications found in 22q11.2 patients in this research. Mutations in <italic>MAPT</italic> gene are described in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease; therefore, it is highly likely that the duplicated region of <italic>MAPT</italic> could be involved in the phenotype of 17q31.21 duplication patients. However, patients with 17q21.31 microduplication present milder phenotypes than patients with the microdeletion, suggesting that microduplications cases are probably unascertained<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p>In the group of 40 patients with CMA, the duplication was frequent but not associated with CHD. However, in the group of patients with 22q11.2DS, the duplication was associated with CHD. This suggests that <italic>KANSL1</italic> microduplication, in combination with 22q11.2 deletion, increases the risk of developing CHD. The effects of the partial duplication in gene function and mechanisms of the interaction are to be elucidated; however, it is known that <italic>KANSL1</italic> is an important factor involved in the epigenetic modifications of histones. Variants in other genes with similar function affect conotruncal heart phenotypes in patients with 22q11.2DS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p>The relationship between histone modifier genes and heart disease has been previously described. It is widely known that epigenetic regulation of gene expression is mainly controlled by dynamic modification of chromatin structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. This regulation mechanism is important during heart development as has been demonstrated in model organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Genes that encode proteins involved in binding or modification of histones proteins have been implicated as disease genes causing heart defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. These data support the idea of a link at a functional level between normal heart development, heart defects, and epigenetic regulation. Moreover, Kabuki (OMIM #147920) and CHARGE syndrome (OMIM #214800) are two examples of diseases that have CHD among other traits in which responsible genes are chromatin modifiers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p>In addition, the miRNA-mRNA network analysis revealed a common regulation between some genes in the 22q11.2 deletion region and <italic>KANSL1</italic>. Interestingly, other genes previously reported as modifiers of the CHD phenotype are regulated in the same module, showing a biological link between modifiers and genes located in 22q11.2 deletion region. This suggests that genes belonging to a common miRNA regulatory network could act as genetic modifiers, and variation in any one of these genes increases the risk of CHD. In this context, miRNA regulatory networks are an emergent field in 22q11.2DS research. The <italic>DGCR8</italic> gene, located in the 22q11.2 deletion, is involved in miRNA biogenesis since it is the cofactor for nuclease DROSHA, which processes primi-RNAs fold into hairpin structures containing imperfectly base-paired stems. DROSHA is an important regulator of miRNA biogenesis, suggesting that miRNA networks could be deregulated during development. Some miRNAs, including miR-150, miR-194 and miR-185, have been reported as differentially expressed in individuals with 22q11.2DS compared to controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. It was proposed that this is related to <italic>DGCR8</italic> haploinsufficiency. Importantly, the expression level of some miRNAs correlated with a set of phenotypes, including heart defects, brain measures, and thyroid abnormalities, suggesting that the deregulated miRNAs may contribute to these characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Results in this study suggest that specific miRNAs regulate genes within the deletion as well as modifiers elsewhere in the genome, increasing the risk of CHD.</p><p>In summary, this study presents robust data showing that a duplication in the 17q31.21 region spanning the exons 1&#x02013;3 of <italic>KANSL1</italic> gene is statistically associated with CHD in Chilean patients with 22q11.2DS. Moreover, <italic>KANSL1</italic> and genes located in 22q11.2 deletion share regulatory mechanisms mediated by miRNA.
