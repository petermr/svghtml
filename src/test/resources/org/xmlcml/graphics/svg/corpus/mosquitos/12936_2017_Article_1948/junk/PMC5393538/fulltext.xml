For some of these applications, the material may come into direct contact with pulpal tissues or with deeply carious dentine, making its biocompatibility and ability to seal in moist environments relevant clinical properties.

</xref>. The mechanism of action proposed for BD effect on dentin is that, first, a degradation of collagenous components occurs due to an alkaline caustic effect, which forms a porous structure that facilitates the permeation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, OH<sup>-</sup>, and CO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>2-</sup>ions, mineralising this substrate<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies demonstrated the formation of reparative dentine after BD pulp capping, which is an evidence for its bioactivity, resulting in a bond with the tissue<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>; however, there are concerns about the stability of this interfacial layer, since only amorphous-calcium-phosphate has been identified, not dentine-like hydroxyapatite<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Bioactive glass (BG) is a well-known bioactive ceramic material that has gained attention due to its ability to chemically bond with hard tissues through the formation of an apatite layer on its surface<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. This apatite layer forms following solution-mediated dissolution of the glass<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. It has been proposed that when BG is in contact with physiological fluids a series of reactions occurs, including: a rapid ionic exchange, creation of silanol bonds on the glass surface, increase of pH with formation of silica-rich region, migration of Ca<sup>+2</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub>
<sup>3-</sup> groups from the solution, which leads to the formation of an apatite layer<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. For this ability, it has been incorporated into a range of products, including synthetic bone grafts to induce hard-tissue regeneration and toothpastes that treat hypersensitivity<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. Recently, a study evaluated the use of BG as a dentine substitute; however, the BG particle size was ca. 700 &#x003bc;m, resulting in poor cavity adaptation with empty spaces between BG particles, and therefore the use of smaller particles was recommended<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Contemporary manufacturing processes allow the synthesis of nanometre-size BG, and BG nanoparticles (nBGs) have superior bioactivity compared with traditional micrometre-size BG, accelerating the formation of hydroxyapatite when it is incorporated into different biomaterials<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>. Brushing exposed dentin tubules with nBGs forms occluding and tightly bonded hydroxyapatite rods that extend deep into dentinal tubules<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>. Hydroxyapatite is less susceptible to degradation than other amorphous calcium phosphate phases with different Ca/P ratio than the stoichiometric crystalline hydroxyapatite (1.67)<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref>. Therefore, it is expected that a hydroxyapatite-based interface provides a more stable seal than an amorphous-calcium-phosphate-based interface, as seen in BD/dentine interface<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>. To the best of our knowledge, nBGs have not been utilised in the formulation or modification of calcium silicate-based cements. The incorporation of nBGs into BD could enhance BD&#x02019;s bioactive properties to stimulate the formation of crystalline hydroxyapatite, equivalent to that of dentine hard tissue.</p><p>The aim of this study was to prepare BD modified with nBGs and assess the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> bioactivity of these novel nanocomposite cements (nBG/BDs).

The assessment of nBG/BD nanocomposite bioactivity demonstrated accelerated apatite-phase formation, compared with unmodified BD. XRD analysis showed earlier apatite crystallisation (after three days), as judged by the appearance of one of the most characteristic apatite reflections at 25.90&#x000b0;, corresponding to the (002) plane of the apatite crystal structure (ICDD&#x000ae; PDF No: 9-432). ATR-FTIR similarly confirmed the earlier presence of apatite deposits on the nanocomposites by the appearance of characteristic PO<sub>4</sub> vibrations of the crystalline apatite structure<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> than BD deposits. Taken together, the combined structural, chemical, morphologic, and elemental analyses showed that the nanocomposites possess enhanced bioactivity, expressed by an accelerated formation of the crystalline apatite-phase on their surface when immersed in SBF, compared with BD.</p><p>The improved bioactivity exhibited by the nanocomposites can be directly attributed to the incorporation of nBGs into the BD matrix.

<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. Therefore, the results in this study suggest that when nBG was incorporated into BD and immersed in SBF, the bioactive ability of the nanoparticles was expressed. The dissolution of BG silicate network into ionic components forms a supersaturated solution, resulting in the nucleation of an amorphous calcium-phosphate layer, which is transformed into apatite<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>. This phenomenon was observed in the nanocomposites after shorter periods of immersion compared with BD, which is due to the rapid dissolution of the nBGs that can form an apatite layer in periods of 24 hours<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>, in contrast to the nanosized BG used in the current work.</p><p>nBGs present high surface area, with greater available surface for interaction with the physiological medium, which accelerates the ionic dissolution process of BG structure and, consequently, apatite formation and crystallisation<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref>. This could explain why the incorporation of low levels of nBGs into the cement matrix (1% wt.) can improve the cement&#x02019;s bioactivity, accelerating the formation of crystalline apatite.</p><p>In addition, there was a distinctive mineral-rich interfacial layer within the dentine in contact with BD and the nanocomposite cements, which was thicker and had greater Si uptake in the dentine treated with nBG-modified cement. This may indicate that the nanocomposites have more prominent mineralisation ability than unmodified BD. The ability of calcium silicate cements to mineralise dentine when immersed in fluids has been previously reported<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>. It is believed that the formation of this interfacial layer could be related to the good marginal seal of calcium silicate cements<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>, supported by reports in which immersion in fluids decreased the marginal leakage of apical plugs<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref> and increased push-out strengths<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>. For BD, this interfacial layer has also been named the &#x0201c;mineral infiltration zone&#x0201d;, which has been attributed to the dual effects of an alkaline caustic etching followed by mineral exchange<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>. This leads to the belief that the mineral deposits could reduce leakage by filling spaces along the interface and via interactions with dentine such as intrafibrilar apatite deposition<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>. The precise role of Si uptake remains unclear, but that silica uptake in dentine may increase its acid resistance and physical strength<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, this interfacial layer was considerably thicker when BD was loaded with nBGs, possibly due to the additional effect of the bioactive ionic species produced by the nBG dissolution, which may diffuse along dentin tubules and induce the formation of apatite deposits. This new remineralisation layer could be formed by the penetration of the biomaterial into the open dentine tubules, and consequent transformation into an apatite phase by contact with the physiological medium. Silica is a key component of nBG and, following dissolution, could act as a nucleation site for the precipitation of dissolved calcium and phosphate ions to form hydroxyapatite<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>. This correlates well with the EDX mapping, where a higher Si content is observed in the mineral phase formed by nBG/BD. The presence of this morphologically different layer occluding previously open tubules suggested that the cement with nBG become lodge within the tubules, where apatite formation took place. Curtis, et al.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref> (2010) have reported similar effect by brushing micro and nano-BG on dentine with exposed tubules. It was found that when nano-BG is applied, a rod-like apatite structure is formed within the tubules<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>, whereas only a surface layer apatite onto the tubule opening was detected with micro-BG. Therefore, the use of BG with nanometric dimensions strongly favours the BG diffusion into the tubules and its consequent transformation into apatite phase. In addition, demineralised dentine can be faster remineralised by nBGs than with micron-sized BG as consequence of the substantially higher rate of dissolution of nBGs<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>It would be interesting to study the long term stability of this interfacial layer in conditions that mimic the dynamics of its possible clinical applications. When BG has been added to other carriers, such as toothpastes, it has been demonstrated that the dentin tubule occlusion layer formed is resistant to acid challenge<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>, and reduces significantly dentine permeability under simulated oral environment<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>30</sup>
</xref>. In addition, it has been suggested that the apatite rods formed into dentine tubules after brushing with nBGs slurries would have excellent retention<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>. This is based on the observation that the continuous occluding apatite rods are tightly bonded to the dentine tubules, therefore the mechanical retention of these rods may be ensured as the angling and contours of the dentin tubule will avoid dislodgement of this interface<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>. Nevertheless, the study of the stability of the mineralised layer observed when nBG/BD was applied onto dentine would be of interest.</p><p>The outstanding ability of BD cement modified with nBGs to accelerate the formation of dentine-like crystalline apatite inside of dentine tubules could have favourable clinical consequences. nBG-modified cement could generate a strongly mineralised seal when moisture control is difficult or could remineralise dentinal tissue in restorative therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The incorporation of nBGs into BD enhances BD&#x02019;s <italic>in vitro</italic> bioactive properties, accelerating the formation of a crystalline apatite layer on its surface after a short period of immersion in SBF and greatly enhances the formation of a mineral-rich interfacial layer when in contact with dentine.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge Professor John Whitworth for his feedback and editorial assistance with the manuscript.
