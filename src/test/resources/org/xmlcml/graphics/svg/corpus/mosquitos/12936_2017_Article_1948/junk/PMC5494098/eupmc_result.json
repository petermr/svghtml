    "The role of gut microbiota in the development of metabolic illnesses has been abundantly demonstrated. Recent studies suggest that gut microbiota alterations may also be related to the development of hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, we aimed to assess differences in the gut bacterial community profiles between hypercholesterolemic subjects and controls. Thirty cases diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia and 27 normocholesterolemic controls were included. A fasting whole blood sample was obtained to determine the lipid profile. In parallel, stool samples were collected and total DNA was isolated to assess the bacterial community profiles by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). In addition, the Richness, Shannon-Weaver, and Simpson indexes were used to evaluate the richness and diversity of bacterial communities. As expected, serum concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol were significantly higher in the cases compared with controls. Moreover, DGGE analysis showed a lower richness and diversity of bacterial communities in hypercholesterolemic subjects. In conclusion, our results showed differences in the profiles of bacterial communities between hypercholesterolemic subjects and controls, suggesting a possible role of the gut microbiota in the development of hypercholesterolemia."
