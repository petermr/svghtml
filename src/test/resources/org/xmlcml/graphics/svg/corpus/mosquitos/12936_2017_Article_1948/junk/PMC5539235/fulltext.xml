Shiga toxins are the major virulence factor of these pathogens, however adhesion and colonization to the human intestine is required for STEC pathogenesis. A subset of STEC strains carry the Locus of Enterocyte Effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island (PAI), which encodes genes that mediate the colonization of the human intestine. While LEE-positive STEC strains have traditionally been associated with human disease, the burden of disease caused by STEC strains that lacks LEE (LEE-negative) has increased recently in several countries; however, in the absence of LEE, the molecular pathogenic mechanisms by STEC strains are unknown. Here we report a 86-kb mosaic PAI composed of four modules that encode 80 genes, including novel and known virulence factors associated with adherence and autoaggregation. Therefore, we named this PAI as Locus of Adhesion and Autoaggregation (LAA). Phylogenomic analysis using whole-genome sequences of STEC strains available in the NCBI database indicates that LAA PAI is exclusively present in a subset of emerging LEE-negative STEC strains, including strains isolated from HC and HUS cases.

Annually, STEC causes over two million cases of acute illness worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Importantly, STEC infection may progress to severe diseases such as hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In humans, STEC pathogenesis involves the initial adhesion of the bacteria to the intestinal epithelium in the ileum, later colonization of the colon and production of Shiga toxin (Stx), thereby impairing epithelial barrier function and ion transport, causing diarrhea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Stx may reach the bloodstream and disseminate to extra-intestinal tissues, producing more severe diseases such as HUS that may result in death. Thus, although Stx is considered <italic>sine qua non</italic> of virulence, adhesion to the intestinal mucosa is a required first step for STEC pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In particular, a subset of STEC strains use an adhesion mechanism called attaching-and-effacing (A/E) lesion, which is characterized by the alteration of the architecture and physiology of the colon epithelial cells. This pathogenic process is mediated by genes encoded in the <bold><underline>L</underline></bold>ocus of <bold><underline>E</underline></bold>nterocyte <bold><underline>E</underline></bold>ffacement (LEE) pathogenicity island (PAI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. To date, STEC strains that are LEE-positive, such as O157:H7 and several serotypes belonging to the &#x0201c;big six&#x0201d; non-O157 STEC O serogroups (O26, O45, O103, O111, O121 and O145), have been the most frequently associated with outbreaks and/or severe illness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Consequently, in the context of STEC infection, the presence of LEE is considered a risk factor for the development of HUS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">However, STEC strains that do not carry LEE (LEE-negative) have also been isolated from cases of severe illness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Indeed, there has been an increase in the number of reports of clinical LEE-negative STEC strains that belong to serogroups O91, O113 and O174<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. For instance, there has been an increase in the detection of O91 strains in Germany from ~5% of all STEC strains isolated from humans in 1999 to ~15% in 2012 and 2013<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Similarly from 2007 to 2012, the serogroups O91 and O113 were among the most common non-O157 serogroups associated with human disease in Netherlands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Recently, the serogroup O174 was identified as one of the four non-O157 serogroups most commonly associated with HUS in Argentina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, in the absence of LEE, the molecular mechanisms by which these strains adhere to the host intestinal epithelium remain largely unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In light of these observations, our group is currently investigating the emergence of LEE-negative STEC strains of clinical relevance. In a previous report, we identified a member of the Heat-resistant agglutinin family (Hra Family) produced by the LEE-negative O113:H21 STEC strain E045-00, which is seroreactive to sera from patients with HUS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In this study, we characterized this antigen named <bold><underline>He</underline></bold>magglutinin from <bold><underline>S</underline></bold>higa toxin-producing <italic>E. coli</italic> (Hes). Much like other members of the Hra family, Hes is a virulence factor that participates in several colonization-associated phenotypes, including hemagglutination, adhesion and autoaggregation. More importantly, we show that the <italic>hes</italic> gene is localized in a 86-kb mosaic PAI composed of 80 genes organized into four modules, one of them (module III) previously described by Shen <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Here we report the complete sequence of this PAI, in which other virulence factors participating in adhesion and autoaggregation are also encoded, such as Iha<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and Ag43<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, respectively. Consequently, this PAI was named the <bold><underline>L</underline></bold>ocus of <bold><underline>A</underline></bold>dhesion and <bold><underline>A</underline></bold>utoaggregation (LAA). We also determined the distribution of this PAI among STEC strains isolated from different sources, showing its presence in a subset of LEE-negative STEC strains, some of which were isolated from cases of HC or HUS. Remarkably, our analyses suggest the acquisition of LAA is probably a recent evolutionary event, which may contribute to the emergence of these pathogens. Thus, this study is a step forward toward an understanding the evolution, emergence and pathogenicity of this subset of STEC strains. Additionally, the identification of this PAI will be useful in epidemiological studies that assess the public health risk of STEC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The Hra Family includes a novel multifunctional protein that is widely distributed in LEE-negative STEC strains</title><p id="Par5">The Hra family is composed of the integral outer membrane proteins Hra1, Hra2, Tia and Hek, which share considerable amino acid sequence similarity but participate in different colonization-associated phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

In a previous study, we identified a member of the Hra family in the outer membrane protein extract of the LEE-negative O113:H21 STEC strain E045&#x02010;00<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The analysis of this protein by mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF/TOF) suggested that it was the Hek protein. During subsequent analysis aimed at determining whether Hek was present in other STEC strains, the amino acid sequence of this protein was used to perform BLASTp searches against the NCBI nr database. Nevertheless, the Hek protein was not detected in any STEC strains. In contrast, we found an allelic variant (GenBank accession: EGW68377) of the Hra family in the LEE-negative O91:H21 STEC strain B2F1, which has 90%, 65%, 65% and 86% amino acid identity with the Hra1, Hra2, Tia and Hek proteins, respectively, and that primarily exhibits amino acid substitutions in predicted loops exposed to the extracellular space (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This variant has not been described previously. Therefore, following the nomenclature used for members of the Hra family, we named it <bold><underline>He</underline></bold>magglutinin from <bold><underline>S</underline></bold>higa toxin-producing <italic>E. coli</italic> (Hes).</p><p id="Par6">To determine the distribution of <italic>hes</italic> in our culture collection (167 STEC strains, including 48 LEE-negative STEC, and 12 fecal <italic>E. coli</italic> isolated from healthy subjects), PCR analysis was performed using primers <italic>hes</italic>_<italic>det1</italic>&#x02009;+&#x02009;<italic>hes</italic>_<italic>det2</italic> (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), which are specific for this gene and do not amplify other allelic variants of the Hra family (Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Strains positive for <italic>hes</italic> were then analyzed by PCR using the primers <italic>hes</italic>_<italic>for</italic>&#x02009;+&#x02009;<italic>hes</italic>_<italic>rev</italic>, which amplify the complete nucleotide sequence of <italic>hes</italic> and other members of the Hra family, and the PCR products obtained were sequenced. Notably, 60% (29/48) of the LEE-negative STEC strains were positive for <italic>hes</italic>, including isolates of serotypes O91:H21, O113:H21 and O174:H21 (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Nevertheless, <italic>hes</italic> was not detected in two strains of the serotype O113:H21. Importantly, the E045-00 strain was positive for <italic>hes</italic>, indicating that the peptide originally mis-identified as Hek is indeed Hes. In addition, sequencing of PCR products indicated that <italic>hes</italic> sequence is 99.7% conserved (data not shown). In contrast, this gene was not detected in any of the LEE-positive STEC strains (0/119) or fecal isolates (0/12). These results indicate that Hes is a novel variant of the Hra family that is widely distributed in LEE-negative STEC strains.</p><p id="Par7">Given the biological role of members of the Hra family, we evaluated whether the <italic>hes</italic> gene product is capable of conferring colonization-associated phenotypes to the non-adherent <italic>E. coli</italic> HB101 strain. When expressed under the control of an inducible promoter, <italic>hes</italic> confers the capacity of agglutination of sheep erythrocytes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>) and autoaggregation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B,C</xref>) to the HB101 strain.

In fact, one of these PAIs, the Subtilase-Encoding Pathogenicity Island, has been identified in LEE-negative STEC strains isolated from humans and animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Given these reports and the mutually exclusive distribution of <italic>hes</italic> with LEE in STEC strains, we sought to determine whether this gene is harbored in a mobile genetic element. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis of the boundaries of the <italic>hes</italic> gene in the draft genome of STEC strain B2F1 (see methods for details), showed that an integrase-encoding gene and the <italic>pheV</italic> tRNA gene are located 3,342 and 4,805&#x02009;bp upstream of the <italic>hes</italic> stop codon, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Also, 23-bp imperfect direct repeats (DR1) that corresponds to the 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>pheV</italic> gene were identified 80,626&#x02009;bp downstream of the <italic>hes</italic> start codon. These DR1 sequences flank a 86,256-bp DNA region with a G&#x02009;+&#x02009;C content of 48%, which is less than the 51% G&#x02009;+&#x02009;C exhibited by the B2F1 chromosome. Additionally, other direct repeats (DR2 to DR7) and several insertion sequence (IS) elements were identified within this chromosomal region. The <italic>yqgA</italic> and <italic>yghD</italic> genes are located next to the DR1 sequences, with the first located upstream and the second downstream. Genome analysis of the laboratory strain <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 indicated that both genes are located in the vicinity of the <italic>pheV</italic> gene (not shown). Thus, <italic>hes</italic> is encoded in a 86,256-bp DNA region that is inserted in the <italic>pheV</italic> gene in the B2F1 strain. In this DNA region, 80 ORFs (open reading frames) were identified, including genes with known functions, some of which are associated with pathogenicity in STEC, as well as several genes and pseudogenes that code for hypothetical proteins (<italic>vide infra</italic>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

With these primers, we examined the presence of the first three modules in our culture collection. As expected, PCR products were obtained only in LEE-negative STEC strains. Among them, 24/48 strains (50%) were positive for all three modules and 6/48 strains (12.5%) for two modules (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). These results demonstrate that LAA is associated with LEE-negative STEC strains and suggest that its modules might mobilize (be acquired or lost) independently of the complete structure.</p><p id="Par15">In order to evaluate the possible mobilization of LAA modules, we performed a <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of genome sequences (draft and complete) from 115 LEE-negative STEC strains, 7 LEE-positive STEC strains, 2 strains of other <italic>E. coli</italic> pathotypes, <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 and 3 commensal <italic>E. coli</italic> strains, which are available in the NCBI database (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">5</xref>) (see methods). First, all draft genome sequences were ordered and aligned using progressiveMauve.

Additionally, phylogroup assignment was conducted <italic>in silico</italic> based on the methods of Clermont <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Finally, a local BLASTn search was performed to determine the presence of LAA, the distribution of its modules and the tRNA loci located close to these sequences. The presence of a module was established when 50% or more of its nucleotide sequence was identified. Our results indicate that LEE-negative STEC strains are phylogenetically diverse. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on whole genome SNPs is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. In general, designation of phylogroup and serotype (antigen H) were consistent with the topology of the tree, with the exception of serotype O8:H19, in which strains were separated into different clades. In contrast, serogroups (O antigens) were polyphyletic. For example, several serotypes belonging to the serogroups O91, O113, O104 and O174 were found in distantly related clades, which is consistent with previous studies demonstrating this genetic diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Remarkably, the complete LAA structure was identified adjacent to the <italic>pheV</italic> gene in 34.8% (40/115) LEE-negative STEC strains from several serotypes (-: H25, O8:H19, O22:H8, O38:H21, O48:H21, O74:H42, O79:H7, O88:H25, O91:H21, O96:H19, O104:H21, O113:H21, O116:H21, O130:H38, O134:H38, O163:H19, O168:H8, O171:H2, O174:H2, O174:H21 and O185:H7), including 3 isolates from HC and 6 from HUS cases. In two additional LEE-negative STEC strains, one isolated from a HC case (O166:H28 str. FHI92) and the other from human feces (O91:H21 str. FHI59, diagnostics not available), we were also able to identify each of the four LAA modules; however they were located adjacent to different tRNA genes (<italic>pheV, selC</italic> and <italic>thrW</italic>). All the above isolates that carry the four LAA modules belong to the phylogroup B1, except the FHI92 strain, which belongs to phylogroup E. Additionally, these strains were associated (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) with Shiga toxin type 2 (Stx2), a toxin that is a risk factor for HUS development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). By contrast, these strains were negatively associated (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) with Shiga toxin type 1 (Stx1), a toxin not associated with an increased risk for HUS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Interestingly, two isolates from the serotype O91:H14 lack this PAI, indicating that this locus is not present in all strains of the same serotype. Furthermore, individual LAA modules were also identified (in some cases forming part of other mosaic PAI-like structures) in several LEE-negative STEC strains, including isolates belonging to phylogroups other than B1. In these cases, the modules were also located adjacent to several tRNA genes (<italic>pheV</italic>, <italic>selC</italic>, <italic>ileX</italic> and <italic>serX</italic>), which suggest the direct acquisition and/or loss of modules. No association between these strains and a Shiga toxin type was found (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Thus, whatever the underlying mechanism (acquisition or deletion), the analysis presented demonstrates the wide distribution and mobilization of LAA modules among LEE-negative STEC strains.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Phylogenetic relationship and distribution of LAA modules between LEE-negative STEC strains and related <italic>E. coli</italic> strains.

Additionally, we assessed the genetic variability of genes encoded within these sequences. In both analyses, the LAA<sub>B2F1</sub> sequence was used as the reference. Notably, the phylogenetic tree of LAA sequences demonstrated that two major lineages (LAA-1 and LAA-2) are found within different strains of a same serotype, including O91:H21, O96:H19 and O174:H21 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>), indicating that these lineages determinations are not linked to serotype.

Additionally, two strains (O166:H28 str. FHI92 and O130:H38 str. 492-1) were clustered outside of the LAA-1 and LAA-2 lineages.

The evolution of these pathogens and the impact of this biological process on their epidemiology constitutes a growing challenge for public health authorities worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In particular, the emergence of the epidemic EAEC/STEC O104:H4 strain, which caused the 2011 outbreak in Germany, changed the epidemiology of diarrheagenic <italic>E. coli</italic> and showed that the genetic plasticity and horizontal gene transfer of these bacteria accelerates their adaptation to a variety of environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In this new epidemiological scenario, it is now accepted that there are LEE-negative STEC strains that represent a potential public health risk. Consequently, it is necessary to determine the molecular mechanisms by which these emerging STEC strains are causing disease in humans. Notably, our findings strongly suggest that in absence of LEE, LAA may be involved as an alternative mechanism of adhesion to the human intestine, in which Hes, Iha, Ag43 and other virulence factors encoded in this locus could participate. Owing to the biological functions of Hes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and Ag43<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, it is possible to hypothesize that LAA-mediated adherence of STEC to intestinal cells would exhibit an aggregative (or &#x0201c;semilocalized&#x0201d;) pattern, which has been reported in isolates of serotypes O91:H21 and O113:H21<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. It must be emphasized that the Hes, NmpC and Ag43 proteins, all encoded in LAA, are reactive to sera from patients with HUS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, indicating that they are synthetized during human disease. Thus, these antigens probably play a role in the development of these pathologies. Furthermore, the complete LAA structure was identified in strains isolated from cases of HC and HUS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Besides, the first three modules of this PAI were detected through multiplex PCR assay in several LEE-negative STEC strains belonging to clinically relevant serotypes (O91:H21, O113:H21 and O174:21) and isolated from different sources, including humans, animals and foods (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Nevertheless, because of its modular nature, LAA may be present as a &#x0201c;complete&#x0201d; (with all four modules) or an &#x0201c;incomplete&#x0201d; (with one, two or three modules) structure in different strains. Importantly, module III, previously described by Shen <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, has been proposed as a molecular marker of LEE-negative STEC strains linked to disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. However, our data revealed that the presence of all modules, not one of them, is most probably associated with disease. It is interesting to note that the complete LAA structure was identified almost exclusively in STEC strains belong to the phylogroup B1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), suggesting that a specific genetic background is required for its acquisition and/or maintenance. Furthermore, we identified two major lineages of LAA that can be present in different, but closely-related strains, including strains of a same serotype (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>), indicating that this PAI has been most likely acquired multiple times via independent events. This supports the idea that the acquisition of LAA through horizontal gene transfer is most likely recent, which may account for the evolution and emergence of these strains. Further studies aimed at understanding the genetic variability between LAA sequences could provide more information about the evolution of this PAI and its possible role in the adaptation of <italic>E. coli</italic> to new niches, such as the human and bovine intestine. Accordingly, it is important to elucidate the participation (or lack thereof) of LAA in human disease, but this is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p id="Par18">To date, it has not been possible to fully define human pathogenic STEC, as there is no single or combination of marker(s), including the determination of serotype, that allows to absolutely predict the potential of a STEC strain to cause human disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.

The number of adherent bacteria was determined by serial dilution and counts of viable bacteria in LB agar. The final result was expressed as the percentage of bacterial cells adhered to the cell layer relative to the number of bacteria added. To quantify the invasiveness of the bacterial strains, we performed a protection assay with gentamicin. One hour after infection, planktonic bacteria were removed by three washes with PBS and the cells were incubated with DMEM medium supplemented with gentamicin (50&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL) for 1.5&#x02009;h. The medium was removed, the cells were washed three times with PBS and the invasive bacteria were recovered by lysis with 0.1% Triton X-100. After serial dilution and a count of invasive bacteria in LB agar, we determined the percentage of invasive bacteria relative to number of bacteria added. All assays were performed three times in duplicate on different days. 5) Visualization of the adherence phenotype. HT-29 cells were cultivated on glass coverslips and infected for 1&#x02009;h, as described above. After three washes with PBS, DMEM medium was added and incubated for 1 more hours.
