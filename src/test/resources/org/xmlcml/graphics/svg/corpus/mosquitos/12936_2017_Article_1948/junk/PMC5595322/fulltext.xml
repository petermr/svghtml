Gingival wound healing is one of the impaired processes found in old rats. Here, we studied the <italic>in vivo</italic> wound healing process using a gingival repair rat model and an <italic>in vitro</italic> model using human gingival fibroblast for cellular responses associated to wound healing. To do that, we evaluated cell proliferation of both epithelial and connective tissue cells in gingival wounds and found decreased of Ki67 nuclear staining in old rats when compared to their young counterparts. We next evaluated cellular responses of primary gingival fibroblast obtained from young subjects in the presence human blood serum of individuals of different ages. Eighteen to sixty five years old masculine donors were classified into 3 groups: &#x0201c;young&#x0201d; from 18 to 22 years old, &#x0201c;middle-aged&#x0201d; from 30 to 48 years old and &#x0201c;aged&#x0201d; over 50 years old. Cell proliferation, measured through immunofluorescence for Ki67 and flow cytometry for DNA content, was decreased when middle-aged and aged serum was added to gingival fibroblast compared to young serum. Myofibroblastic differentiation, measured through alpha-smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;-SMA), was stimulated with young but not middle-aged or aged serum both the protein levels and incorporation of &#x003b1;-SMA into actin stress fibers. High levels of PDGF, VEGF, IL-6R were detected in blood serum from young subjects when compared to middle-aged and aged donors. In addition, the pro-inflammatory cytokines MCP-1 and TNF were increased in the serum of aged donors. In old rat wound there is an increased of staining for TNF compared to young wound. Moreover, healthy gingiva (non injury) shows less staining compared to a wound site, suggesting a role in wound healing. Moreover, serum from middle-aged and aged donors was able to stimulate cellular senescence in young cells as determined by the expression of senescence associated beta-galactosidase and histone H2A.X phosphorylated at Ser139. Moreover, we detected an increased frequency of &#x003b3;-H2A.X-positive cells in aged rat gingival tissues. The present study suggests that serum factors present in middle-aged and aged individuals may be responsible, at least in part, for the altered responses observed during wound healing in aging.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Fondecyt</institution></funding-source><award-id>11140064</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0456-0721</contrib-id><name><surname>C&#x000e1;ceres</surname><given-names>M&#x000f3;nica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Fondecyt</institution></funding-source><award-id>1160518</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cerda</surname><given-names>Oscar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>UINICIA</institution></funding-source><award-id>44051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0456-0721</contrib-id><name><surname>C&#x000e1;ceres</surname><given-names>M&#x000f3;nica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Fund for Science and Technology (Fondecyt) Grant 11140064 (MC), UINICIA 44051 Grant from Universidad de Chile (MC) and Fondecyt Grant 1160518 (OC).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The proportion of people over 60 years old is growing faster than any other age group. By 2050, the number of people over 60 years is projected to be five times than in 1950 [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Aging is associated with a decline in health, and altered gingival wound healing is one of the impaired processes found during aging [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>During wound healing, coagulation is activated through the formation of a fibrin clot that serves as a temporary matrix, providing a mesh of fibrin and a reservoir of cytokines and growth factors like PDGF, TGF&#x003b2;1 and 2, EGF, VEGF, HGF, FGF-2, RANTES, MIP-1&#x003b1; and IL-8 [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0184189.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This group of early growth factors provides chemotactic cues to recruit inflammatory cells into the wound site, initiates reepithelization and the migration and proliferation/activation of fibroblasts [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Three to five days after injury, the formation of the granulation tissue begins, with the migration and activation of fibroblasts, endothelial cells and macrophages into the blood clot [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. About 7 to 10 days after wounding, the granulation tissue becomes hypercellular containing abundant fibroblasts and endothelial cells. During this process fibroblasts are differentiated into active myofibroblasts, a transient cell population involved in the synthesis and organization of the newly formed extracellular matrix and wound contraction [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Importantly, myofibroblast differentiation is important for matrix deposition and organization during wound healing. To do that, myofibroblast express a new actin isoform known as &#x003b1; smooth muscle actin that reinforces the wound remodeling capacity of these cells [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Using the parabiosis animal model, that connects the circulatory system of young and old animals, previous studies have described an improvement in the repair of aged bone fracture [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and muscle lesions in aged conditions [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and reversion of age related impairments in cognitive functions and synaptic plasticity in mice [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These studies have suggested that growth factors present in the blood of aged subjects may play a detrimental role in wound healing. Interestingly, the role of blood-derived factors in oral wound healing remains unknown.</p><p>The present study was designed to evaluate whether factors present in the serum of aged and middle-aged subjects may partially reproduce delayed wound-healing responses associated with aging.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Primary cultures of human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) were obtained from healthy gingival tissue surrounding bicuspids obtained from non-smoking, systemically healthy individuals.

Therefore, serum derived factors might be responsible, at least in part, for delayed wound healing responses associated with aging.</p><p>Our study suggests that aging may have an early manifestation in serum related to the variations in some inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. These changes included an increase in MCP-1 and TNF in the serum of aged subjects evaluated in this study and a decrease in PDGF, VEGF and IL-6R. In addition, no changes were found in TGF&#x003b2;1 and HGF protein levels. According to these findings, the augmented levels of inflammatory cytokines might contribute with increased levels of inflammatory cells in tissues that may delay wound repair. It is important to consider that TGF&#x003b2;-stimulated myofibroblastic differentiation is effectively inhibited by the inflammatory cytokine TNF as described for dermal [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and gingival fibroblast [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In addition, TNF may impair wound healing in diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], suggesting that this cytokine is probably implicated in delayed wound healing in different contexts. The results described in our study suggest that increased TNF levels found in serum from middle-aged and aged donors may be responsible for the decrease in myofibroblastic differentiation found in cells exposed to these factors. More studies are needed to identify and quantify the amount of TGF&#x003b2;1, TNF and other relevant cytokines during wound healing in young and aged tissues.</p><p>The diminished levels of PDGF and VEGF found in the serum of middle-aged and aged subjects might also contribute to explain the reduction in cell proliferation observed in our study. PDGF and VEGF are also involved in cell migration [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although we did not test this possibility in the present study, these assays should identify other relevant functions putatively modulated by serum factors in aged subjects.</p><p>Previous studies have evaluated PDGF, VEGF and TGF&#x003b2;1 serum levels in 18 years old males. These determinations were similar to our findings with measurements approaching 1.7 ng/mL for PDGF, 20 ng/mL for TGF&#x003b2;1 and 91.83 pg/mL of VEGF [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, a similar result was obtained by Bayer <italic>et al</italic>, (2012), who found that TGF&#x003b2;1 serum levels did not change with age [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, work by Weibrich et al (2002) analyzed platelet rich plasma of 203 donors between 17 and 62 years old and found no influence of gender or age on platelet count [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>In recent studies, Belsky <italic>et al</italic> (2015) analyzed the correspondence between chronological and physiological ages. In that study they evaluated young adults of 38 years old, showing a great discrepancy between chronological age and biological age [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These results coincide with our observations concerning the concentration of soluble mediators present in serum in the middle-aged group. Further studies are needed to better characterize aging within this group.</p><p>It has been proposed that senescent cells develop the so called senescent associated secretory phenotype (SASP), a trait characterized by the production of growth factors, matrix remodeling enzymes and inflammatory cytokines that include IL-6 and IL-8 among others [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this work we have observed MCP-1 and TNF are found at increased levels in the serum of aged subjects. It is possible to propose that these inflammatory cytokines may be responsible for the detrimental effects of middle-aged and aged serum on cell proliferation and myofibroblastic differentiation. It is interesting to consider whether cells responsible for the secretion of these cytokines are involved cellular senescence at some level. Moreover, our observation of the effect of middle-aged and aged serum on the induction of cellular senescence in young fibroblasts may also suggest that serum may contribute to the initiation of cellular senescence in tissues. It is important to consider that in aged organisms the proportion of senescent cells may vary between 1% to 15% [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Hubackova <italic>et al</italic> (2016) demonstrated that TNF&#x003b1; and IFN gamma induce cellular senescence in mouse tumor cells [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Given our observation of increased TNF levels in the serum of aged subjects it is interesting to propose whether this cytokine may play a role in the induction of cellular senescence in periodontal tissues.</p><p>Interestingly, diabetes delay wound healing, which may result in limb amputation. Enhanced levels of advanced glycation end product (AGEs) and TNF are associated with these phenomena. Impaired wound healing in diabetic animals are improved by blocking TNF, which reduces infiltration by proinflammatory macrophages, decreases fibroblast apoptosis and improves collagen synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0184189.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Wang et al demonstrates that &#x003b3;-H2A.X immunohistochemistry is a reliable quantitate indicator of senescence in fibroblast.
