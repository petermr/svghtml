We isolated influenza virus (H1N2) from a swine in a backyard production farm in Central Chile and demonstrated that the HA gene was identical to that in a previous report. Its HA and neuraminidase genes were most similar to human H1 and N2 viruses from the early 1990s and internal segments were similar to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. The virus replicated efficiently in vitro and in vivo and transmitted in ferrets by respiratory droplet. Antigenically, it was distinct from other swine viruses. Hemagglutination inhibition analysis suggested that antibody titers to the swine Chilean H1N2 virus were decreased in persons born after 1990. Further studies are needed to characterize the potential risk to humans, as well as the ecology of influenza in swine in South America.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords: </title><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>swine influenza virus</kwd><kwd>South America</kwd><kwd>backyard farm</kwd><kwd>transmission</kwd><kwd>zoonoses</kwd><kwd>influenza A</kwd><kwd>H1N1 pandemic strain</kwd><kwd>backyard production system</kwd><kwd>viruses</kwd><kwd>H1N2</kwd><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>Chile</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>In the past decade, variant swine-origin influenza A viruses (swIAVs) of subtypes H1N2 and H3N2 have been associated with human infections, particularly in persons with close contact to swine (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>), although evidence of human-to-human transmission is minimal. The emergence and subsequent pandemic caused by the unique influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (pH1N1) from swine in 2009 highlights the public health threat posed by swIAVs, especially in populations having little preexisting immunity (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>). Therefore, it is imperative to understand the circulation of swIAVs on a global level.</p><p>While our knowledge of the global diversity and evolution of swIAVs has increased, less information has been available regarding swIAVs circulating in South America. Recently, subtypes H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 were identified in commercial pigs in Chile (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). Phylogenetic analysis from 18 swIAVs sequenced from a 2012 cross-sectional sampling of 22 production companies in Chile (95% of their commercial swine) demonstrated extensive genetic diversity in the hemagglutinin (HA) segment (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). The human seasonal H1-like viruses were unique to swine in Chile and not closely related to other H1 swIAVs. These viruses represented 2 independent introductions from humans, with Chile H1 human I clade most closely related to human viruses from the late 1980s and Chile H1 human II clade most closely related to human viruses from the early 1990s (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). No further phylogenetic or virus characterization information was available.</p><p>In addition to commercial pig farming, Chile has an extensive backyard production system, a common form of animal production throughout the world. Backyard production farms (BPFs) are a particular public health concern given poor biosecurity and close interaction between humans and multiple animal species (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>). During 2014, we conducted active backyard production system surveillance in Chile&#x02019;s main swine production area (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>) and isolated a subtype H1N2 swIAV virus (A/swine/Chile/YA026/2014; sw/Chile). We performed phylogenetic analyses and full genomic sequencing on this virus to determine its relationship with other known influenza isolates. We propagated it in primary human bronchial and swine respiratory epithelial cells, as well as C57Bl/6 mice, to determine its infectiousness. We also characterized its transmission using ferrets. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays with human serum samples were done to assess the risk this virus poses for human infection, and serological analyses were conducted with pig serum samples from Chile to determine the prevalence of the virus and its risk for emergence. </p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Study Area and Nasal Swab Sampling</title><p>Active surveillance was conducted as described (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>) in 40 BPFs in Central Chile, representing 90% of the backyard production system.

Our study furthers the data recently published on prevalence and HA phylogeny of Chile swIAVs (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). We show that these viruses are circulating outside of commercial swine herds in BPFs, where animal&#x02013;human interaction is high.</p><p>Since emergence of pH1N1 in 2009, reverse transmission of the virus from humans to pigs has been documented worldwide, resulting in several reassortments with classical swine and seasonal human viruses (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>). As of July 2016, variant (v) influenza viruses have caused over 380 human infections in the United States alone. While most of these infections have been H3N2v viruses, 8 have been H1N2v viruses. These infections are particularly concerning because most infections occurred in children (persons &#x0003c;18 years of age) who had direct or indirect exposure to swine (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>). Census estimates indicate that 50% of BPFs in Chile have <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>1 person born after 1990, and 35% have <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>1 person born after 2000 (C. Hamilton-West, unpub. data). Our data indicate that younger age groups have reduced HI titers to sw/Chile virus; however, studies with serum samples obtained from throughout the population of Chile are warranted to better determine the risk these viruses pose to swine herds.</p><p>This study is subject to several limitations. First, these studies were limited to 1 virus isolate. A panel of swine viruses from Chile isolated from different years and regions warrant study, especially if genetic differences are found among viruses. Second, these results represent a limited number of the backyard production system within Chile. Enhanced swine surveillance throughout Chile and South America is needed. Third, studies at the animal&#x02013;human interface are required to decipher the risk circulating swIAVs pose to humans. We were limited to serum samples from persons living in North America, and further work should be done on South America populations, especially with those exposed to swine. Antigenic cartography on serum samples from persons involved in backyard farming would provide invaluable new information on transmission of swine viruses to humans. Finally, further work is needed to improve understanding of swIAV genes involved in transmission in the ferret model.</p><p>Despite no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, increased risk for human infection with H1N2v viruses calls for further study and enhanced monitoring. Risk for possible emergence of zoonotic strains has been demonstrated worldwide. H1N2 viruses isolated from pigs in China replicated efficiently in mice and pigs (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><italic>32</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><italic>36</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><italic>37</italic></xref>), while viruses from South Korea and Europe transmitted to and even caused death in ferrets (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><italic>33</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><italic>34</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><italic>38</italic></xref>). Future work will focus on how these reassortants arose in Chile BPFs and the role of specific genetic differences in pathogenicity and transmissibility. In addition, further studies for seroprevalence in Chile BPF workers and antigenic cartography with the sw/Chile virus are necessary. Studies at the animal&#x02013;human interface are needed to determine seroprevalence, identify broadly protective antibodies, and characterize T-cell responses, and active surveillance is needed to uncover infection rates to better determine the risk for zoonotic transmission of swine-origin H1N2 to human health.
