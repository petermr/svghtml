Her main complaint was bilateral forefeet pain and difficulty at walking.</p><p>On clinical exam of the right foot, fifth medial toe was downward and medially deviated underneath the fourth toe, leading to skin ulceration of the overlapping surfaces of both toes. The fifth lateral toe was externally rotated, abducted and dorsally displaced. A painful callus in the dorsum of the fifth lateral toe was noted. On the left foot, a hypoplastic lateral supernumerary toe with cutaneous irritation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2050313X17737197">Figure 1</xref>). Plain orthogonal weight-bearing films confirmed a complete bilateral duplication of the proximal phalanges of both fifth rays. The left supernumerary toe was clearly hypoplastic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2050313X17737197">Figure 2</xref>). The patient elected to undergo surgical treatment for her condition. Given the ulcerated lesions of the fourth and medial fifth toe, the pre-operative plan considered an excision of the right fifth medial toe. Taking in to account the lateral fifth toe deformity (external rotation, abduction and dorsal displacement) and possible instability caused by the excision of the medial fifth toe, a plantar plate repair and medial collateral ligament reconstruction for the right lateral fifth toe was planned. For the left lateral supernumerary fifth toe, excision was decided.</p><fig id="fig1-2050313X17737197" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Bilateral fifth toes polydactyly.

Under regional anesthesia, we applied the tourniquet at the thigh area. Both feet were prepared and draped. Antibiotic prophylaxis was given. First, the left foot was operated. A double elliptical incision over the lateral supernumerary toe was performed, followed by complete, careful, excision of the rudimentary toe. Wound closure was performed in a layered fashion. Then, a bandage and a cotton roll were applied on the left foot.</p><p>Second, the right foot was addressed. Ulcers observed under the first two phalanges of the fourth and medial fifth toe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2050313X17737197">Figure 3</xref>) prompted excision of the medial duplicated toe. A racquet-shaped incision was performed over the fifth MTP joint, followed by careful dissection of the deep tissue layers and articular capsule liberation. Complete excision of the medial fifth toe was performed, followed by ostectomy of the fifth metatarsal medial head with a micro-sagittal oscillating saw. No disruption of the plantar plate was observed, although widening and laxity were evident. Proximally, the plantar plate was liberated using a McGlamry elevator. Distally, the plantar plate was sectioned, protecting the fifth toe flexor tendons. Reconstruction of the plantar plate was performed by drilling two holes running from the dorsal cortex to the plantar rim of the proximal phalanx. Thereafter, number 2 FiberWire<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Arthrex, Naples, FL, USA) was used to approximate the distal plantar plate to the proximal phalanx and then both sutures ends were recovered through the drill holes at the proximal phalanx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2050313X17737197">Figure 4</xref>). Finally, both suture ends that were tied over the dorsal phalangeal cortex managed to fix the plantar plate onto the base of the proximal phalanx, at the same time rotating the toe back into the desired anatomical position. Medial collateral ligament was reconstructed using the same FiberWire<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Arthrex, Naples, FL, USA). Wound closure was performed in a layered fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2050313X17737197">Figure 5</xref>). A sterile compressive dressing (with the toe in slight plantarflexion) with flexible self-adhesive wrap and postoperative shoe was applied. Weight bearing was allowed using multipurpose orthopedic footwear.</p><fig id="fig3-2050313X17737197" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>An ulcerated lesion under the first two phalanges of the fourth and over the distal phalanges of the medial fifth toe was observed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2050313X17737197-fig3"/></fig><fig id="fig4-2050313X17737197" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Complete excision of the fifth medial toe followed by exostectomy of the fifth metatarsal medial head.

In this particular case, we favored medial supernumerary toe excision given the presence of ulcerative lesions between the medial fifth and fourth toes. However, the lateral supernumerary toe presented with a dorsiflexed, externally rotated and abducted deformity. Therefore, restoration of adequate alignment of the toe was imperative to re-establish if forefoot anatomy and mechanics are to be enhanced. Given this complex clinical scenario, a plantar plate repair and a medial collateral ligament reconstruction were considered.

We think that the plantar plate is the principal stabilizer of the MTP joint; therefore, its reconstruction is of paramount importance for forefoot biomechanics. We present an original approach in which reconstruction of the stabilizing structures of the MTP joint provided sufficient stability to restore forefoot balance and patient satisfaction in the short term. More studies are needed to provide evidence of the efficacy of this treatment modality.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Ethical approval:</bold> Ethical approval was obtained by Hospital Cl&#x000ed;nico Universidad de Chile Ethics Committee on August 2016.
