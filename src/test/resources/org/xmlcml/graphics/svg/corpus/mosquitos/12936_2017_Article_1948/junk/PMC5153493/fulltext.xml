Blood glucose lowering effects have been ascribed to maqui berry (<italic>Aristotelia chilensis</italic>) extracts in humans after boiled rice consumption. In this study, we aimed to explore whether a standardized delphinidin-rich extract from maqui berry (Delphinol) affects glucose metabolism in prediabetic humans based on glycemia and insulinemia curves obtained from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after a challenge with pure glucose. Volunteers underwent four consecutive OGTTs with at least one week washout period, in which different doses of Delphinol were administered one hour before glucose intake. Delphinol significantly and dose-dependently lowered basal glycemia and insulinemia. Lower doses delayed postprandial glycemic and insulinemic peaks, while higher doses reversed this tendency. Glycemia peaks were dose-dependently lowered, while insulinemia peaks were higher for the lowest dose and lower for other doses. The total glucose available in blood was unaffected by treatments, while the total insulin availability was increased by low doses and decreased by the highest dose. Taken together, these open exploratory results suggest that Delphinol could be acting through three possible mechanisms: by inhibition of intestinal glucose transporters, by an incretin-mediated effect, or by improving insulin sensitivity.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>MNL-Chile</funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Frequent excessive postprandial glucose and insulin excursions represent a risk factor for developing diabetes, associated with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired insulin tolerance (IIT), inflammation, dyslipidemia, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-cell dysfunction, and endothelial dysfunction [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The maintenance of healthy blood sugar levels and controlled carbohydrate metabolism is a rapidly growing concern in most developed countries and increasingly also in developing countries, due to the increased awareness of the hyperglycemia risks resulting from unhealthy diets and sedentary lifestyle [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Further to dietary self-limitation and physical activity efforts, consumption of plant secondary metabolites may substantially contribute to improving carbohydrate and lipid metabolism [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Long term epidemiologic studies have pointed to dietary factors affecting the risk for developing diabetes. Investigation of data from the Nurses Health Studies (NHS) has resulted in interesting findings related to elevated regular consumption of different flavonoid classes and disease risk reduction [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Higher consumption of anthocyanins was associated with lower risk for type II diabetes in US adults, based on the follow-up of 70359 women in the NHS (1984&#x02013;2008) and 89201 women in NHSII (1991&#x02013;2007) and also 41334 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986&#x02013;2006) [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Interestingly, this study found no significant correlation between other flavonoid subclasses and even total flavonoid consumption related to risk reduction for type II diabetes. A follow-up of the NHS II (93600 women) suggested that anthocyanin intake in the form of blueberries and strawberries would correlate with decreased myocardial infarction risk [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A recent epidemiologic study suggests that regular higher intake of flavonoid species anthocyanins, flavones, and flavanones is associated with greater likelihood for good health and wellbeing in individuals surviving to older ages [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Polyphenols are well described to exhibit inhibitory effects on <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucosidase and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-amylase enzyme activities, thus delaying absorption of complex food carbohydrates [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Particularly, the oligomeric proanthocyanidins potently delay hydrolysis of starchy foods to glucose, some of which appear to be more effective than acarbose medication [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Consumption of anthocyanin-rich crowberry-fortified blackcurrant juice was described to attenuate significantly the postprandial blood glucose and insulin peak 90 minutes after glucose challenge, as compared to consumption of the same sugared beverage void of crowberry fortification [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Delphinidin anthocyanins extracted from maqui berries (<italic>Aristotelia chilensis</italic>), indigenous to Chile, are especially rich in glucoside and sambubioside derivatives. They have recently been ascribed to inhibit the sodium-glucose cotransporter type 1 (SGLT1) in rat duodenum. Delphinol, a proprietary maqui berry extract with a standardized content of 25% w/w delphinidin glycosides and 35% total anthocyanins, was found to significantly inhibit postprandial blood glucose 60 and 90 minutes after boiled rice intake [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], with a single 200&#x02009;mg dose before food consumption.</p><p>We here describe the results of open exploratory investigations on the effect of different doses of Delphinol on blood glucose and insulin in fasting conditions and postprandial effects after glucose ingestion, by applying a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in study participants with impaired glucose tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

All participants provided their written informed consent for participation in the research project. The present study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines. The study protocol was approved by the ethical committee of Mutual de Seguridad, Santiago, Chile. Subjects were permitted to discontinue participation at any time without providing reasons. Pregnancy testing in women with childbearing potential was only performed at the first visit. During the first health checkup, specimens were collected from all enrolled participants for blood rheology, standard blood chemistry, lipid profiling, and complete urine analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Study Design and Protocol</title><p>This investigation was an open exploratory study initiated for identifying acute dose effects of a standardized maqui berry extract (Delphinol) on postprandial blood glucose. Delphinol is mainly composed of polyphenols and is standardized to contain more than 25% delphinidin glycosides by HPLC area under the curve (AUC), using purified reference standards delphinidin-3-sambubioside-5-glucoside, delphinidin-3,5-diglucoside, delphinidin-3-sambubioside, and delphinidin-3-glucoside. Furthermore, Delphinol is standardized to contain no less than 35% total anthocyanins, comprising also cyanidin glycosides with the same glycosylation patterns as those in delphinidins. Many further nonanthocyanin flavonoid species with the same glycosylation patterns are present in Delphinol [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, unpublished results]. Delphinol has been shown to be safe in acute and chronic toxicity assessments at doses of 1&#x02009;g/kg body weight. Delphinol is commercialized as a dietary supplement in most parts of the developed world, predominantly as an antioxidant [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and for blood glucose management [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Capsules bearing 60, 120, and 180&#x02009;mg Delphinol (batch 13156, MNL, Santiago, Chile), manufactured by Barnafi Krause Farmac&#x000e9;utica SA (Santiago, Chile), were used in this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Subjects</title><p>According to the inclusion criteria, a total number of 36 prediabetic subjects were initially enrolled, 20 women and 16 men aged 19 to 50 years. Additional seven participants were recruited at a later time to increase the statistical power. This group comprised 4 women and 3 men aged 37 to 43 years, all of them being prediabetic. In the first visit, the health status of the subjects was checked by an interview to register their clinical history and a complete physical examination. Routine analyses (complete blood count, biochemical and lipid profiles) and a diagnostic OGTT were also performed. At the end of each visit, participating volunteers were interviewed for adverse effects.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test and Insulin Measurements</title><p>Study participants were screened for eligibility by means of an oral glucose tolerance test after Trutol&#x000ae; (75&#x02009;g of glucose as a 296&#x02009;mL aqueous solution, Thermoscientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) intake, measuring basal (fasting), 30-, 60-, 90-, and 120-minute blood glucose and insulin levels, with glycemia and/or insulinemia exceeding values as in the aforementioned inclusion criteria.</p><p>For the study of dose effects, each participating subject was given a single dose of Delphinol (nil, 60, 120, or 180&#x02009;mg) on different test days, with minimum of one-week intermission between tests. After an overnight (10&#x02013;12 hours) fasting period, subjects were cannulated after arrival at the medical facility and remained lying on a hospital bed over the entire investigational period. An initial 4&#x02009;mL blood sample was taken and the corresponding dose of Delphinol was subsequently administered. One hour later, participants were subjected to an OGTT, swiftly ingesting a standard 75&#x02009;g glucose solution (Trutol). For the OGTT, in total, five 4&#x02009;mL blood samples were taken in intervals of 30&#x02009;min. The first blood sample was collected before glucose ingestion, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The subsequent four samples were collected in 30-minute intervals during two hours after glucose intake. All samples were collected in Becton Dickinson (BD) Vacutainer tubes containing EDTA and sodium fluoride, centrifuged at 4.000&#x02009;rpm on an ALC PK 120 centrifuge for 5 minutes, and stored at 4&#x000b0;C for laboratory measurements.</p><p>Glucose was estimated by a GOD-PAP colorimetric assay using a Selectra autoanalyzer (Vitalab, Smithfield, USA). Calibration was performed daily according to lab protocols. All samples were processed following standard procedures. Insulin was analyzed by direct chemiluminescence using an ADVIA Centaur XP Immunoassay System (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Statistical Analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were carried out using MINITAB 17 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA), Origin Pro 8 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA, USA), and SAS 9 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). One-tailed paired comparisons were used to identify significant differences in basal glucose values at a 5% significance level (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 0.05) after ingestion of different Delphinol doses. For the comparison of different doses on subjects, repeated measures mixed ANOVA model was used in which subjects were treated as a random effect and doses as a repeated effect. The variance-covariance matrix was modeled using the options for the repeated statement provided in Proc MIXED (SAS) with a Toeplitz structure to allow for an autoregressive covariance model. After the general repeated measures ANOVA, least-squares-means multiple comparisons were performed among doses. For the multiple comparisons, a Dunnett-HSU approach was applied using Proc MIXED (SAS Institute). One-tailed hypothesis testing was used to compare the control dose (nil) to 60, 120, and 180&#x02009;mg doses. All reported mean values are least-square means due to the nonbalanced mixed model fitting the overall comparisons model.</p><p>Due to practical reasons and design limitations, after recruitment of seven additional subjects,<italic> a priori</italic> (planned) comparisons between control dose (nil) and the 120&#x02009;mg dose were done using one-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-tests for glucose and insulin.

Regarding estimated effect size, a mean reduction of 3.4&#x02009;(<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>IU/mL) was observed for the 180&#x02009;mg dose.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>3.3. Dose Effects of Delphinol on Postprandial Glucose in an OGTT</title><p>All subjects tolerated the treatment with Delphinol well, with no adverse reactions reported during interviews of participants. None of the participants departed from the study prior to completion of all experiments.</p><p>As presented in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, blood glucose and insulin OGTT curves present distinctly different kinetics in response to the Delphinol dose applied. Within thirty minutes after glucose ingestion, a dose-dependent effect of Delphinol on the rapidly increasing postprandial glucose was observed. For untreated subjects, blood glucose rose markedly higher during the diagnostic tests in absence of Delphinol than with prior intake of Delphinol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(c)</xref>). A linear regression for the glucose maximum peak height as a function of the applied Delphinol dose calculated a significant nonzero negative slope (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0273). Insulinemia reached higher peak values in subjects treated with Delphinol for the lowest 60&#x02009;mg dose, while for higher doses the tendency was to equate the maximum values of the control, with a slight tendency to even lower values for the 180&#x02009;mg dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(c)</xref>).</p><p>Borderline statistical significance versus untreated control was identified in glycemia for 120&#x02009;mg (<italic>p</italic> = 0.117) and 180&#x02009;mg (<italic>p</italic> = 0.126) Delphinol 30 minutes after glucose intake. Based on these results, we chose to increase the sample size for the 120&#x02009;mg dose in order to corroborate these results and elevate the statistical power of the test. Seven additional prediabetic subjects, 4 women and 3 men, aged 37 to 43 years, were recruited and investigated by the same procedures as described earlier. The glucose and insulin single<italic> a priori</italic> comparisons, including the 7 additional recruits, testing 120&#x02009;mg Delphinol versus control, are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>. As a result, from the a priori comparisons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>), we found that application of a single 120&#x02009;mg Delphinol dose significantly decreased 30&#x02009;min postprandial (OGTT) blood glucose (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), whereas the corresponding postprandial lowering of insulin remained statistically insignificant.</p><p>During the subsequent period from 30&#x02009;min to 60&#x02009;min after glucose intake, blood glucose and insulin curves show surprisingly diverging developments in response to the applied Delphinol dose. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>, in Delphinol-treated subjects, glycemia peaks showed a dose-dependent retardation of the maximum value for the 60 and 120&#x02009;mg doses, compared to the untreated subjects, and a continued rise of glucose and insulin values persists until 60&#x02009;min after glucose intake. For the highest Delphinol dose of 180&#x02009;mg, this peak delay is reversed back to 30 minutes after glucose challenge and a more pronounced decrease is attained in the maximum glycemia value than that for lower doses. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>, insulinemia also showed a similar delay in the appearance of peak maxima, but the reversal of this tendency for the 180&#x02009;mg dose was less conspicuous than that in the glycemia curve. Nevertheless, insulinemia values 120 minutes after the glucose challenge were smaller than the control with all doses and particularly with the highest dose.</p><p>Surprisingly, the lowest applied dose of 60&#x02009;mg Delphinol presents with the highest glucose level at 60&#x02009;min, reaching borderline statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.056) versus untreated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>). The insulin level recorded for the 60&#x02009;mg dose correspondingly presents with the highest value of all four applied Delphinol doses at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>). It is noteworthy that 60&#x02009;min after glucose challenge the lowest glucose level was found for the untreated control, whereas the lowest insulin value was presented with 180&#x02009;mg Delphinol.</p><p>A noticeable divergence related to dose effects is apparent for the insulin levels 90&#x02009;min after glucose challenge. Whereas higher glucose values at this time with 60 and 120&#x02009;mg Delphinol are reflected by correspondingly high insulin values, the values decline in the untreated control and likewise, to the same extent, with the 180&#x02009;mg dose. Two hours after glucose intake, glucose levels reach the lowest values for the untreated control and 180&#x02009;mg Delphinol dose. Remarkably, with 180&#x02009;mg Delphinol, the insulin level remained at the lowest levels throughout all investigational time points.</p><p>In order to estimate the total amount of glucose and insulin available in the blood during the OGTT, we calculated a time normalized area under the curve (AUC) for glycemia and insulinemia values. For glycemia, this value is equivalent to the glycemic index (GI) [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(b)</xref> show these results. No significant difference was found for any Delphinol dose compared to the control, but tendencies can be observed for both curves. Glucose availability tended to be almost constant for all groups. Insulin showed a clearer trend, with more availability for the lowest 60&#x02009;mg dose and a discernible tendency to decrease as dose increases. In fact, for the 120&#x02009;mg dose, the availability is similar to that of the control, whereas for the highest 180&#x02009;mg dose this value is inferior to that of the control. Interestingly, the tendencies of insulin availability at different doses parallel those of maximum insulin peak heights.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4.

While oligomeric proanthocyanidins potently inhibit <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucosidase activity and effectively lower postprandial blood glucose following starchy meals, the absorption of monosaccharides, especially glucose itself, remains little affected by most flavonoid species. Berries of various natures, consumed as pulp or juice, have repeatedly been demonstrated to limit the rise of blood glucose and insulin in response to sucrose challenge. In all these studies, inhibition of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucosidase was ascribed to delay hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose and fructose [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Some polyphenolic species such as epicatechin gallate have been ascribed to show inhibitory effects to sodium-glucose cotransporter activity [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Delphinidins have been demonstrated to inhibit SGLT1 activity in rat duodenum in Ussing chambers, and acute intake of 200&#x02009;mg Delphinol correspondingly significantly lowered postprandial blood glucose and insulin following a 75&#x02009;g boiled rice challenge in a healthy human pilot trial [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, clinical evidence for inhibition of glucose absorption, such as in an oral glucose tolerance test, to date remains absent for delphinidin aglycon as well as for delphinidin-derived anthocyanins. Hence, we conducted a study using a naturally delphinidin-rich maqui berry extract (Delphinol) in order to investigate dose related inhibition of glucose absorption in human volunteers using standard OGTT. We chose to study prediabetic subjects in expectation of greater effects on postprandial glucose alterations following acute intake of Delphinol. Furthermore, no previous study has clinically established the Delphinol minimum acute dose required for significant lowering of postprandial blood glucose in OGTT. This prompted us to test acute doses of 60, 120, and 180&#x02009;mg Delphinol versus untreated control in an OGTT in repeated investigations with the same subjects.</p><p>Unexpectedly, we discovered that acute intake of Delphinol alone, in the absence of any carbohydrate exposure, at all Delphinol doses tested, simultaneously lowered both postprandial fasting blood glucose and insulin one hour after intake, in a dose-dependent and significant fashion. An acute simultaneous reduction of blood glucose and insulin with dietary polyphenols at fasting conditions, to our knowledge, has not been described before. The investigation of underlying mechanisms of action related to this observation was beyond the scope of the research project. Since Delphinol was previously described to inhibit SGLT1 activity in small intestine, it was intriguing to speculate whether Delphinol may potentially inhibit SGLT1 or SGLT2 in kidneys, affecting renal glucose reabsorption with glucose lost to urine [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Investigation of possible glucosuria was not part of the research protocol; however, a<italic> post hoc</italic> investigation of only three subject volunteers participating in the trial showed that, following a single intake of 180&#x02009;mg Delphinol at fasting conditions, urine collected over the subsequent hour did not contain measurable quantities of glucose (data not shown). Though the observation on the absence of glucosuria is limited, this finding nonetheless suggests that delphinidin glycosides in maqui berries may not lower fasting glucose as a result of glucosuria.</p><p>The effects of Delphinol presented here shall be of particular interest for individuals with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, as pancreatic <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-cells may be less burdened by excess insulin secretion. The insulin sparing effect identified for Delphinol is particularly appreciable as it manifests also at fasting conditions. The observation that insulin levels were lowered following Delphinol ingestion (prior to OGTT), and with a single dose of 180&#x02009;mg persisted lower throughout the monitored 120&#x02009;min period, as compared to untreated control as well as lower Delphinol doses, points to potential pancreatic health contributions. This discovery of Delphinol effects on insulin merits future research, which may explore fasting glucose and pancreas function related to insulin response improvement, especially following regular supplementation with Delphinol. Although sugar metabolism effects of other polyphenols present in maqui berry may not be excluded at this point, it has already been described that a particular anthocyanin, delphinidin 3-sambubioside 5-glucoside (D3S5G), displays insulin-like effects in muscle and liver cells and seems to be partially responsible for the antidiabetic effect of maqui berry extracts [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>We found that applied Delphinol doses significantly lowered blood glucose 30 minutes after glucose challenge, which may arguably be partially attributed to the drop in fasting glucose subsequent to Delphinol intake. Yet, our findings confirm that Delphinol decreases absorption of dietary glucose further to previous investigations of T&#x000f6;rr&#x000f6;nen and coworkers who gave starchy foods to subjects [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Our results are coherent with the SGLT1 inhibition by delphinidins described by this study.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the postprandial blood glucose and insulin dynamics are profoundly altered in relation to the Delphinol dose applied, from the time point 30&#x02009;min after glucose ingestion. Surprisingly, the 60&#x02009;min postprandial blood glucose values are present in inverse order with respect to the Delphinol dose applied to subjects. Whereas in untreated control blood glucose dropped to an average of 126.8&#x02009;mg/mL 60&#x02009;min after glucose challenge, the average values with Delphinol ranged higher at 129.1, 134.1, and 139.1&#x02009;mg/mL, for 180, 120, and 60&#x02009;mg Delphinol, respectively. This observation may appear to be contradictory to inhibition of SGLT1 with Delphinol. However, it is noteworthy that supplementation with Delphinol occurred one hour prior to glucose challenge and delphinidin glycosides may potentially no longer persist at physiologically fully active concentrations in the small intestine two hours past Delphinol intake.</p><p>In the same line, the observed delay of blood glucose peaks can be seen as the effect of a partial SGLT1 inhibition at lower dosages. This inhibition is expected to be higher in the proximal segments of the intestine, which would imply a slower glucose absorption in the duodenum and a retarded absorption in the following intestinal segments. As doses grow higher, inhibition is expected to be more complete, including inhibition at the same higher level in both proximal and more distal intestinal segments, which would cause a recovery of the form of the glucose curve and a concomitant lowering of blood glucose, as observed with the 180&#x02009;mg Delphinol dose. Interestingly, the peak retarding effect induced by Delphinol in low doses partly mimics the shape of curves of lower glycemic index foods [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>However, none of the above-discussed mechanisms could account for the rise of the insulin peak and the higher insulin availability observed with the lowest 60&#x02009;mg Delphinol dose (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). In fact, while the tendency for glucose peaks is to decrease as the Delphinol dose increases (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) and total glucose availability remains constant during the OGTT for all treatment groups, this better control seems to require higher absolute levels of insulin and higher insulin secretion for the lowest dose tested. This is counterintuitive, since lower blood glucose cannot by itself trigger more insulin secretion in normal conditions. Therefore, apart from the possible inhibition of intestinal glucose transporters, Delphinol should have a more direct effect on insulin secretion. Whether this effect is mediated by incretins or is a direct action on pancreatic <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-cells cannot be ruled out by the current evidence.</p><p>Strikingly, the case of the highest 180&#x02009;mg dose presents a radically different effect: its glycemia peak is the lowest among all treatments and control, and the total amount of glucose in blood during the OGTT remains the same, while the insulin peak is also the smallest. However, the total amount of circulating insulin required for this is also the lowest among all treatments and control. This evidence indicates that the same amount of glucose is managed more efficiently with less insulin, which in turn suggests that Delphinol could also improve insulin sensitivity of target tissues in a direct or indirect manner, making this a third possible mechanism by which Delphinol could act on glucose metabolism.</p><p>Other groups investigating polyphenol impact on postprandial glucose applied anthocyanins as blackcurrant juice, fortified with additional crowberry (<italic>Empetrum nigrum</italic>) powder (100&#x02009;g/L) and adding sucrose (50&#x02009;g/L) to the juice [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Plasma glucose and insulin were lowered with crowberry-fortified sugared blackcurrant juice 30&#x02009;min past consumption, though nonsignificant compared to the sweetened blackcurrant juice alone. Interestingly, significantly higher blood glucose and insulin levels were identified 90&#x02009;min after consumption of sucrose-sweetened and crowberry-fortified blackcurrant juice, as compared to sweetened blackcurrant juice without crowberry. These postprandial glucose and insulin kinetics are in conformance with our findings, showing elevated glucose and insulin at 60 and 90&#x02009;min, resulting from anthocyanin consumption. T&#x000f6;rr&#x000f6;nen and coworkers attribute the attenuation of postprandial glucose and insulin to <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucosidase inhibition, resulting in delayed sucrose hydrolysis, and speculate on the possibility for additionally impaired intestinal glucose transport [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As we used glucose in our experimental setting, any possible effects of Delphinol on carbohydrate hydrolysis are ruled out.</p><p>Hoggard et al. measured postprandial OGTT curves after Polycal (49% polysaccharides, 12% glucose, 0.6% maltose) consumption, on 8 patients with diabetes or IGT to which 470&#x02009;mg of bilberry (<italic>Vaccinium myrtillus</italic>) extract was given before the trial [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this study, total anthocyanins doses were much higher than in our trial. Since they used a mixture of glucose and polysaccharides on patients with more advanced disease states than in our study, their results are not comparable to our findings. Indeed, they reported statistically significant lower postprandial glucose levels only 120, 150, and 180 minutes after Polycal consumption, in contrast to our findings, which suggests intestinal absorption played a more delayed role in their experimental setting.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>We have demonstrated for the first time that a maqui berry extract standardized in its anthocyanin content (Delphinol) is able to simultaneously reduce fasting blood glucose and insulin levels in prediabetic patients when administered in a single dose. A significant effect was obtained even for very low doses of Delphinol: only 60&#x02009;mg of Delphinol, corresponding to 21&#x02009;mg of maqui berry anthocyanins, was statistically significant for the basal glucose drop. A dose of 180&#x02009;mg of Delphinol, corresponding to 63&#x02009;mg of maqui berry anthocyanins, was effective in significantly decreasing fasting insulin levels. These results are unique because these trials were performed in prediabetic humans and not in an animal model.</p><p>Furthermore, in contrast to previous studies that used disaccharides (sucrose) or complex polysaccharides sources (Polycal or boiled rice) to measure OGTT, we used pure glucose, the gold standard procedure. In these conditions, we demonstrated that a single 120&#x02009;mg Delphinol dose decreases the glycemic peak 30 minutes after glucose challenge in a single dose trial. Our results show also tendencies for maximum postprandial blood glucose peaks to decrease with all tested Delphinol doses in a dose-dependent manner. Trends were also detected for insulin peaks, which tend to decrease with higher Delphinol doses. A similar decreasing tendency with higher Delphinol doses was observed for the total amount of insulin available in blood during the OGTT. Even though significant differences and trends were only demonstrated for some measures, clear nonlinear tendencies are observed for many parameters, but formal demonstration of statistical significance would require the development of new statistical tests for trends. In a simpler approach, for 30&#x02009;min glycemia measures, we demonstrated that observed differences were easily resolved by including only ~20% more volunteers in the study, in order to reach statistical significance.</p><p>Although it is too soon to describe a potential biochemical mechanism of action by which Delphinol is able to decrease blood glucose and insulin levels, taken together, our results suggest that Delphinol could be acting on glucose metabolism by three different possible mechanisms: (1) by inhibition of intestinal glucose transporters, (2) by an incretin-mediated effect on insulin secretion, or (3) by improving the insulin sensitivity in target tissues. These possible mechanisms are in line with the results of Rojo et al. [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which describe insulin-like effects in liver and muscle cells of delphinidin 3-sambubioside 5-glucoside, one of the main anthocyanins of maqui berry, and identify this particular purified anthocyanin as, at least partially, responsible of the antidiabetic effects. However, in the present work, we cannot rule out that other polyphenol components of Delphinol could also be synergetically having insulin-like effects, as described, for example, by Cameron et al. [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We can discard inhibition of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-glucosidases, in our particular case, as we used pure glucose as the OGTT challenge. The exact nature of these putative mechanisms should be the research matter of future studies on maqui berry extract, in attendance to the utility that they may have in the management of chronic glucose metabolism conditions, such as metabolic syndrome and prediabetes. In this sense, this work adds to previous works and is part of a continuous and ongoing effort to better characterize maqui berry extracts, find effective doses, measure effects on glucose metabolism, and shed light on possible mechanisms of action for standardized maqui berry extracts.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>SGLT1:</term><def><p>Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SGLT2:</term><def><p>Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OGTT:</term><def><p>Oral glucose tolerance test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IGT:</term><def><p>Impaired glucose tolerance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IIT:</term><def><p>Impaired insulin tolerance.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing Interests</title><p>This study was supported by an unconditional research grant from MNL-Chile to the Reproductive Health Research Institute, Pontificia Universidad Cat&#x000f3;lica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ludwig</surname><given-names>D.
