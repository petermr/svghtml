Previous studies described a TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> transgenic mouse model that develops progressive motor dysfunction in the absence of protein aggregation or significant motoneuron loss, questioning its validity to study ALS. Here we have further characterized the course of the disease in TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> mice using a battery of tests and biochemical approaches. We confirmed that TDP-43 mutant mice develop impaired motor performance, accompanied by progressive body weight loss. Significant differences were observed in life span between genders, where females survived longer than males. Histopathological analysis of the spinal cord demonstrated a significant motoneurons loss, accompanied by axonal degeneration, astrogliosis and microglial activation. Importantly, histopathological alterations observed in TDP-43 mutant mice were similar to some characteristic changes observed in mutant SOD1 mice. Unexpectedly, we identified the presence of different species of disulfide-dependent TDP-43 aggregates in cortex and spinal cord tissue.

ALS patients develop paralysis of voluntary muscles, accompanied by an exaltation of tendon reflexes, muscle weakness, spasticity and atrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in patients over 65 years old after Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, and it is characterized by the progressive failure of frontal and temporal lobes of the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Clinical manifestations of FTD include changes in behavior and personality, accompanied by language alterations. Importantly, a fraction of FTD patients also develop motoneuron diseases, including ALS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, suggesting that they are part of a unique pathological spectrum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Tar DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) was identified as the major constituent of the ubiquitinated protein inclusions present in brain and spinal cord of most cases of ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated inclusions (FTLD-U), a type of FTD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Under normal conditions, TDP-43 locates in the nucleus with functions related to transcriptional regulation, mRNA stability, mRNA traffic, pre-mRNA splicing and miRNA biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the subcellular distribution of TDP-43 is altered in ALS/FTD, with the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions containing ubiquitinated and phosphorylated forms of the protein, in addition to proteolytic fragments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Mutations in the TDP-43 gene are also described in familial and sporadic cases of ALS (revised in ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>). TDP-43 pathogenesis is proposed to emerge due to a loss-of-function in the nucleus combined with a &#x0201c;gain of toxic&#x0201d; activity in the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The histopathological features related to TDP-43 have also been found in sporadic and familial cases of ALS and FTD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Due to the failure of most translational efforts derived from studies using&#x000a0;mutant SOD1 mice (present in less than 2% of ALS cases), it is essential to develop and validate new complementary models to study ALS.</p><p id="Par4">Several animal models to study TDP-43 pathogenesis have been developed in mouse and rats with a variety of phenotypes and histopathological features (reviewed in ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>). For example, the overexpression of human wild-type TDP-43 (TDP-43<sup>WT</sup>) in neurons causes motor impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Transgenic mice expressing TDP-43<sup>WT</sup> in the hippocampus, cortex and striatum develop learning and memory deficits, as well as&#x000a0;altered motor control <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Gliosis is also detected in most mouse models overexpressing TDP-43<sup>WT</sup>&#x02009;
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In these models, ubiquitin positive cytoplasmic inclusions can be found in spinal cord motoneurons&#x000a0;and brainstem neurons. Other groups have developed inducible transgenic mice to study TDP-43 pathogenesis. The expression&#x000a0;of a truncated TDP-43 form, lacking the nuclear localization, leads to neuronal loss in certain forebrain regions, corticospinal tract degeneration and also motor spasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Motor and cognitive alterations have been also found in mice expressing TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> mutant at 3 months of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. All these studies suggest that different patterns of TDP-43 expression result in either motor dysfunctions or behavioral alterations depending on the tissue and levels of transgene expression, generating a phenotype resembling FTD-ALS. However, none of the models described so far are optimal to study ALS because of the apparent absence of motoneurons degeneration.</p><p id="Par5">One of the first mouse models described to study TDP-43 biology expresses the ALS-linked mutation A315T controlled by mouse prion promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The original report indicated that this model undergoes a selective loss of upper motoneurons, correlating with cortical gliosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. This transgenic line also showed gait alterations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and loss of muscle strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Although TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> transgenic mice developed motor problems, the authors failed to identify lower motoneuron loss or signs of TDP-43 aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, questioning its possible use to study ALS pathophysiology.</p><p id="Par6">Here we have further characterized the TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> transgenic mice using a battery of motor and biochemical assays. As reported before, we confirmed the gender differences in the progression of motor problems, observing that females TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> mice live longer than males, despite having similar duration of the symptomatic stage. Remarkably, we observed the progressive appearance of coordination and motor problems. Importantly, histopathological analysis using serial sections revealed the occurrence of extensive neuronal loss in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, in the same population affected in a&#x000a0;well described mutant SOD1 mice. Accordingly, total axons at the ventral root of mutant TDP-43 mice were decreased, accompanied by an augmented number of degenerating axons. Moreover, we observed clear signs of microglial and astrocyte activation, to a similar extent as mutant SOD1 transgenic mice. Finally, using different biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that spinal cord and cortical brain tissue contain distinct species of disulfide-crosslinked aggregates of TDP-43 that were sensitive to reducing agents. Taken together, our study suggests that TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> transgenic mice develop important features linked to&#x000a0;ALS and FTD that were previously unrecognized, highlighting its possible use to study disease pathogenesis and the development of&#x000a0;future therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Differential survival of male and female TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> transgenic mice</title><p id="Par7">In order to investigate the consequences of expressing mutant TDP-43 in mice, we further characterized a transgenic line which overexpresses TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> under the control of the murine prion protein promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

However, initial characterization of spinal cord and cortical brain tissue failed to detect signs of abnormal protein aggregation&#x000a0;in TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Interestingly, several studies in mutant SOD1 mice have indicated that most protein oligomers and aggregates are formed through disulfide crosslinks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, which can be detected using standard biochemical methods in the absence of reducing agents. Therefore, we evaluated the presence of oligomers containing TDP-43 in symptomatic TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> mice using tissue extracts of frontal cortex and spinal cord by Western blot under in non-reducing conditions. Remarkably, strong aggregation of TDP-43 was observed in cortical tissue of mutant mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>, left panel). Treatment of protein extracts with the reducing agent DTT fully disassembled TDP-43 aggregates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>, right panel). Surprisingly, these high-molecular-weight species were not observed in spinal cord tissue from the same animals under similar conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). In addition, the presence of TDP-43 fragments were&#x000a0;detected on this biochemical analysis. In order to further characterize TDP-43 aggregates, we performed a filter trap assay, which detects large aggregated species over 0.22&#x02009;&#x003bc;m in size. Surprisingly, we found no retention of TDP-43 protein derived from cortex extracts in the membrane, neither of poly-ubiquitinated proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>), suggesting the presence of oligomers rather than high molecular weight&#x000a0;aggregates in this brain region. Unexpectedly, we detected large TDP-43 and poly-ubiquitinated aggregates in spinal cord tissue of TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> mice using filter trap, which was more consistent in female animals as also observed for motoneuron loss (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). This opposing result of Western blot and filter trap analysis may be due to the fact that large protein aggregates do not enter to the staking gel during the electrophoresis and are lost during Western blot processing. Again, addition of thiol reducing agent to the protein extract (DTT treatment) prevented detection of aggregated species by the filter trap assay. Immunohistochemistry analysis of ubiquitin also confirmed the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in both cortex and spinal cord tissue obtained from transgenic animals at symptomatic stage (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C and F</xref>). These results suggest that different oligomeric and aggregated species of TDP-43 are present in spinal cord and motor cortex of symptomatic TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> mice. As previously reported, we did not find the accumulation of large TDP-43 protein inclusions in affected areas of the nervous system as measured by immunofluorescence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).

Mutant TDP-43 mice also displayed a gender-associated phenotype, consistent with the observation that male ALS patients have a higher risk to develop ALS when compared to women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> mice develop a complex neurodegenerative phenotype, associated with significant motoneuron loss and axonal degeneration, microglial and astrocyte activation, and abnormal protein aggregation. Importantly, distinct disulfide-crosslinked forms of TDP-43 were found in spinal cord and brain cortex&#x000a0;of symptomatic animals.</p><p id="Par14">Overall, our results indicate that the overexpression of human TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> causes a progressive motor phenotype. The first description of this mouse model highlighted a &#x0201c;flipper&#x0201d; like motor syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and a following study reported motor impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> mice die early because of constipation problems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, which can be bypassed with fiber-deprived jellified food, expanding the window to observe the degenerative process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. This intestinal dysfunction is suggested to be a relevant factor contributing to the&#x000a0;early death of this transgenic line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. However, the fact that we observed significant rates of neuronal and axonal loss, glial activation and motor alterations&#x000a0;suggests the occurrence of an active neurodegenerative process. We also found clear differences in the phenotype between genders, where motor alterations and body weight loss occur earlier in male animals. However, both male and female mice, displayed similar duration of the symptomatic phase. Since male and female transgenic mice express similar levels of TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup>, gender-specific factors may explain the differential vulnerability observed at the level of neuronal survival and the progression of disease features. Importantly, we were able to detect robust motoneuron degeneration after performing detailed histological analysis using serial sections, in addition to report evident glial activation to a similar extent as mutant SOD1 mice.</p><p id="Par15">TDP-43 is mislocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm&#x000a0;in the affected neurons of ALS and FTD patients, observing TDP-43-positive inclusions in a small fraction of neurons. In addition, hyperphosphorylated, ubiquitinated and fragmented forms of TDP-43 are observed in CNS tissue during the disease process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Although TDP-43 aggregation is observed in near&#x000a0;97% of ALS cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, the mechanism of action involved in ALS pathogenesis is still not clear. Initial characterization of TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> mice failed to detect TDP-43 aggregation, however the presence of large ubiquitin-positive cytoplasmic inclusions was reported in cortical regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The current study provide evidence indicating that expression of TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> under the prion promoter in mice triggers major behavioral and histopathological alterations involved in ALS/FTD, correlating with the accumulation of distinct oligomeric species of TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup>. In addition, the levels of glial activation and the areas of the spinal cord presenting motoneuron loss closely resembled the pathological alterations reported in mutant SOD1 mice, as well as biochemical features including the accumulation of disulfide-crosslinked protein aggregates.</p><p id="Par16">In other neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease and Huntington&#x02019;s disease, the accumulation of soluble oligomers has a pivotal role in inducing synapse failure and neuronal dysfunction (review in refs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>). Similarly, studies with ALS-linked SOD1 mutants also suggest that oligomers are highly toxic because they can diffuse easily to reach&#x000a0;their molecular targets (see examples in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>). Using different biochemical approaches, we could detect distinct abnormal TDP-43- species in cortex and spinal cord. In particular, we observed TDP-43 oligomers by western blot in brain cortex but not spinal cord extracts, whereas higher-order aggregated species of the protein were detected in spinal cord by filter trap assay. These data suggest that TDP-43 aggregation by disulfide crosslinks is more prominent in spinal cord, possibly contributing to motor problems and motoneurons loss. Although reproducible aggregation of mutant TDP-43 was observed in tissue obtained from end stage mice in our western blot analysis, variability in the levels of high molecular weight TDP-43 aggregates was observed using the filter trap assay. Although we did not explore the biochemical mechanisms explaining these differences it is well-known that both techniques identify distinct oligomeric species and the phenotype associated with larger aggregates may be less penetrant. As described for mutant SOD1-based models, protein aggregates can cause ER stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, protein transport blockage, alter&#x000a0;organelle function, inhibition of proteasome machinery, decreased chaperone activity, among others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.

Since&#x000a0;we detected a similar profile of motoneuron loss in TDP-43<sup>A315T</sup> and mutant SOD1 mice, this&#x000a0;may underlie a common mechanism of&#x000a0;differential neuronal vulnerability to the disulfide-crosslinked aggregates accumulating of both mouse models.

Visualization of the slices was done in a microscope Olympus model IX71 with bright field.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Histological analysis of spinal cord</title><p id="Par19">Animals were perfused in a transcardiacal form with 0.9% NaCl and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1&#x02009;M phosphate buffer (PBS) at pH 7.4. For lumbar spinal cord extraction, sciatic nerve was located because it represents the most caudal part of the lumbar section to procedure to make a straight parallel cut. From that reference point another cut was done 5 mm towards rostral direction in order to define our lumbar section. The section was post-fixed on 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Later, the lumbar spinal cords were incubated on a 7.5% sucrose solution for 1&#x02009;h, changed after to a 15% sucrose solution for 1&#x02009;h and then changed again to a 30% sucrose solution overnight at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Finally, the sections were embedded on optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue Tek) and using a cryostat (Leica) slices of 25&#x02009;&#x000b5;m thick were prepared from caudal to rostral. All the sections were collected individually in 1X PBS 0.1% sodium azide. For stereological analysis, through anti-ChAT immunohistochemistry, 16 slices were selected with a distance of 200&#x02009;&#x000b5;m each to cover around 3.2 mm of the lumbar section of the spinal cord. Immunohistochemistry was done using standards methods, including epitope retrieval incubating slices on 1&#x02009;M Citrate Buffer for 5&#x02009;min at 90&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, washing with 1X TBS and incubating after on 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and 10% Methanol solution for 15&#x02009;min and wash with 1X TBS. Spinal cord slices were incubated with anti-ChAT antibody (1:250, Millipore) in blocking solution for overnight at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C as reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. After that, slices were incubated with anti-goat-IgG-biotin antibody on blocking solution (1:500, Santa Cruz). Avidin/biotine reaction was performed using a DAB peroxidase Vector Kit (SK-4100). Visualization of the slices was done in a microscope Olympus model IX71 with bright field. Inmunofluorescence was carried out with standard methods. The spinal cord cuts were incubated with anti-TDP-43 (1:500, ProteinTech Group), anti-GFAP (1:500, Abcam) or anti-Iba1 (1:500, Wako) on blocking solution, with secondary antibody (anti-rabbit, 1:1000, Alexa 488) and with the nuclear marker Hoechst (1:5000, Invitrogen) in PBS1X. Visualization of the slices was done by confocal microscopy using the Olympus IX71 microscope and images were captured with 1934 Fast QImaging QICAM camera. ImageJ software was used for fluorescent intensity analysis. For cresyl violet staining, 6 slices were selected with 500&#x02009;&#x000b5;m each to cover around 3.2 mm of the lumbar section of the spinal cord. The slices were stained with 0.5% cresyl violet acetate and visualization of the slices was done in a microscope Olympus model IX71 with bright field.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Ventral roots quantification</title><p id="Par20">A separate cohort of three transgenic TDP-43 mutant mice and three non- transgenic littermates (controls) at end stage were deeply anesthetized and sacrificed by cardiac transection at end stage. Ventral roots axons were extracted and fixed in 5% buffered glutaraldehyde (pH 7.4) at 4&#x02009;C for 48&#x02009;h. Semi-thin cross-sections (1&#x02009;&#x003bc;m) were stained with toluidine blue, rinsed and coverslipped. Nerve root sections were imaged at 100X magnification as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Due to low percentage of axonal loss in the transgenic TDP-43 mutant animals (6.13% in TDP-43 mutant animals versus 2.79% in non- transgenic littermates) manual counting was performed of a total of more than 1800 myelinated axons per genotype. No filter was used in the quantification. Axons were defined as conserved or degenerated by the appearance of the myelinated nerve fiber in cross sections. Each category was defined according to the nerve fiber morphologies, as shown in supplementary material (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). No evident changes in fiber sizes were found on first inspection. Therefore, the percentage of degenerated axons versus conserved ones was quantified.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Immunoblotting and filter trap</title><p id="Par21">Cortex and spinal cord extracts were homogenized in 100&#x02009;&#x000b5;L of 1% PBS Triton X-100 supplemented with a protease inhibitor mix (Roche) and phosphatases inhibitors. For filter-trap and Western blot analysis, brain homogenates were diluted in TEN (10&#x02009;mM Tris-HCl, 1&#x02009;mM EDTA, 100&#x02009;mM NaCl, pH 8.0, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors mix) buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 50&#x02009;mM iodoacetamide, sonicated, and quantified.

Statistics tests used to determine the normality of the data were Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Onmibus D&#x02019;Agostino &#x00026; Pearson and Shapiro-Wilk. To determine the differences in data analysis that had a normal distribution, t-Student, one-way ANOVA and two-way ANOVA were used (for multiple comparisons). In the case of data analysis that they did not have a normal distribution, nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used to detect differences. It was considered with a value of p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 a difference statistically significant. All these tests were performed using the computational software GraphPad Prism 5.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Data Availability</title><p id="Par23">All data and associated protocols are available to others without preconditions.
