    "Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are neuromuscular transmission disorders caused by mutations in genes encoding neuromuscular junction proteins. A 61-year-old female and her older sister showed bilateral ptosis, facial and proximal limb weakness, and scoliosis since childhood. Another female sibling had milder signs, while other family members were asymptomatic. Facial nerve repetitive stimulation in the proband showed decrement of muscle responses. Single fiber EMG revealed increased jitter and blocking. Muscle biopsy showed type 2-fiber atrophy, without tubular aggregates. Mutational analysis in the three affected siblings revealed two compound heterozygous mutations in DOK7: c.1457delC, that predicts p.Pro486Argfs*13 and truncates the protein C-terminal domain, and c.473G>A, that predicts p.Arg158Gln and disruption of the dok7-MuSK interaction in the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain. Unaffected family members carried only one or neither mutation.Two of the affected sisters showed marked improvement with salbutamol treatment, which illustrates the benefits of a correct diagnosis and treatment of DOK7-CMS."
