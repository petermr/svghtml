Although partial flower longevity compensation was found, the functional role of R. montanum&#x02019;s long-lived flowers was strongly masked by a second source of pollen limitation attributable to a greater tendency for geitonogamous pollination on larger clones at higher elevations. The long-term fitness benefits of clonal growth in the harsh alpine environment appear to outweigh the seasonal fitness losses associated with residual quantitative pollen limitation plus additional qualitative pollen limitation.</p></abstract><abstract><title>Abstract</title><p>Low pollinator visitation in harsh environments may lead to pollen limitation which can threaten population persistence. Consequently, avoidance of pollen limitation is expected in outcrossing species subjected to habitually low pollinator service. The elevational decline in visitation rates on many high mountains provides an outstanding opportunity for addressing this question. According to a recent meta-analysis, levels of pollen limitation in alpine and lowland species do not differ. If parallel trends are manifested among populations of alpine species with wide elevational ranges, how do their uppermost populations contend with lower visitation? We investigated visitation rates and pollen limitation in high Andean <italic>Rhodolirium montanum</italic>. We test the hypothesis that lower visitation rates at high elevations are compensated for by the possession of long-lived flowers. Visitation rates decreased markedly over elevation as temperature decreased. Pollen limitation was absent at the low elevation site but did occur at the high elevation site. While initiation of stigmatic pollen deposition at high elevations was not delayed, rates of pollen arrival were lower, and cessation of pollination, as reflected by realized flower longevity, occurred later in the flower lifespan. Comparison of the elevational visitation decline and levels of pollen limitation indicates that flower longevity partially compensates for the lower visitation rates at high elevation. The functional role of flower longevity, however, was strongly masked by qualitative pollen limitation arising from higher abortion levels attributable to transference of genetically low-quality pollen in large clones. Stronger clonal growth at high elevations could counterbalance the negative fitness consequences of residual pollen limitation due to low visitation rates and/or difficult establishment under colder conditions. Visitation rates on the lower part of the elevational range greatly exceeded community rates recorded several decades ago when the planet was cooler. Current pollen limitation for some species in some habitats might underestimate historical levels.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Alpine</kwd><kwd>Amaryllidaceae</kwd><kwd>Andes</kwd><kwd>floral senescence</kwd><kwd>flower longevity</kwd><kwd>flower visitation rates</kwd><kwd>global warming</kwd><kwd>low-quality pollen</kwd><kwd>pollen limitation</kwd><kwd><italic>Rhodolirium montanum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A plant is said to be pollen limited when its fruit or seed set falls below the maximum a plant&#x02032;s resources can sustain as a result of insufficient availability of pollen (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Burd 1994</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Larson and Barrett 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Ashman <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Knight <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>).

Deposition of genetically low-quality pollen on stigmas can lead to qualitative as opposed to quantitative pollen limitation (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Aizen and Harder 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Harder and Aizen 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Arceo-G&#x000f3;mez and Ashman 2014</xref>). This source of pollen limitation is more difficult to detect but can be significant. In addition to these various extrinsic factors, absolute levels of pollen limitation are shaped by breeding system (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Larson and Barrett 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Knight <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">Vamosi <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>), ovule bet-hedging (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Burd 1995</xref>; but see <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Rosenheim <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>), and parental optimism (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Rosenheim <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Persistent pollen limitation can threaten population persistence (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Robertson <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Pattemore and Anderson 2013</xref>). Consequently, in outcrossing species habitually subject to low pollen availability, we expect to find functional traits or adaptations leading to the avoidance of strong pollen limitation.</p><p>In the alpine zone above the treeline, where air temperature descends at an average global rate of 6.0 K per 1000 m increase in elevation (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000f6;rner 2003</xref>), flower-visitation rates are known to decline with increasing elevation (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Arroyo et al. 1982</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Arroyo and Squeo 1990</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Bingham and Orthner 1998</xref>). However, while many alpine species show some pollen limitation (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Galen 1985</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Elberling 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">Totland and Sottocornola 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Kasagi and Kudo 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Mu&#x000f1;oz and Arroyo 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Torres-D&#x000ed;az <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Ai <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000e1;zaro <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>), a meta-analysis found no difference in the intensity of pollen limitation between alpine and lowland species (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Garc&#x000ed;a-Camacho and Totland 2009</xref>; see also <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000e1;zaro <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). This result suggests that an analogous trend could be expected among populations of outcrossing alpine species situated at different elevations above the treeline. That is, if alpine and lowland species, in general, do not differ in pollen limitation, individual populations of alpine species found along the elevational gradient above the treeline are not expected to either in spite of demonstrated decreases in visitation rates from the treeline upwards. Under these circumstances we expect alpine species to possess traits that enable their high elevation populations to overcome pollen limitation. Understanding how outcrossing species avoid pollen limitation in the alpine could shed light on how species in other habitats characterized by harsh conditions for pollinators (e.g. Arctic, tropical cloud forests) deal with this problem.</p><p>High elevation populations of alpine species could avoid excessive pollen limitation via the possession of long-lived flowers (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Arroyo et al. 1981</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Primack 1985</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Bingham and Orthner 1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Steinacher and Wagner 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Torres-D&#x000ed;az <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). This hypothesis, coined the &#x02018;increased pollination probability hypothesis&#x02019; (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Arroyo <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>), sees long-lived flowers allowing a plant to &#x02018;sit and wait&#x02019; for greater amounts of time to be visited when pollinators are scarce (cf. <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Ashman <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). Long-lived flowers are an intrinsic property of some alpine species (<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Steinacher and Wagner 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Torres-D&#x000ed;az <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Pacheco <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). Although potential flower longevity (measured in pollinator-excluded flowers) does not necessarily increase with elevation in such species, compensation of lower visitation rates at higher elevations can be expected. High seed set in some high nival plants with fairly long-lived flowers is associated with pollen deposition over several days of the flower life span (<xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr">Wagner <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). In some alpine species, potential flower longevity increases with elevation (<xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">Utelli and Roy 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Blionis and Vokou 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Giblin 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Duan <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Ai <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">Trunschke and St&#x000f6;cklin 2016</xref>). Such increases could be the result of selection on flower longevity (<xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">Utelli and Roy 2000</xref>), but in many cases are likely to be the result of the plastic extension of the flower lifespan under cooler temperatures and which can compensate for slower pollination (cf. <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Arroyo <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our goals were to compare elevational trends in flower-visitation rates and pollen limitation and to examine the functional role of a species&#x02019; intrinsically long-lived flowers in compensating for lower visitation rates at high elevations in the high Andes of central Chile. We used <italic>Rhodolirium montanum</italic> (Amaryllidaceae) as a focal species. Like many amaryllids (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Arroyo and Dafni 1995</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Baker <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>), <italic>R. montanum</italic> is characterized by large long-lived flowers (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Pacheco <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). If flower longevity compensation occurs at higher elevations in <italic>R. montanum</italic>, levels of seed set should be greater than expected from the depression in visitation rates. Because we expect lower flower visitation rates at higher elevation, stigmatic pollen deposition should commence later in the flower lifespan and/or occur in smaller daily dosages. Under slower or less intense pollination, given that pollination provokes floral senescence (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Lundemo and Totland 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Castro <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Shahri and Tahir 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Arroyo <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>), we expect realized flower longevity to become more prolonged with increasing elevation. The overall aims were to investigate whether pollen limitation remains constant over the elevational range of <italic>R. montanum</italic> as occurs at a large spatial scale for alpine versus lowland species, and to shed light upon the functional role of flower longevity in compensating for lower visitation rates at the higher elevations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study species and area</title><p>
<italic>Rhodolirium montanum</italic> (syn: <italic>Rhodophiala rhodolirion</italic>) is a large-flowered, high elevation Andean geophyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). In the Farellones-Valle Nevado area (33&#x000b0; Latitude S) where the present work took place, <italic>R. montanum</italic> is distributed over 1400 m of elevation (1800&#x02013;3200 m a.s.l.). <italic>R. montanum</italic> becomes increasingly clonal with elevation. Single-bulbed individuals are commonly found on the lower end of the elevational range but become increasingly rare as elevation increases. Genets comprising up to 21 loosely connected flowering bulbs have been found in the upper part of the elevational range (D. Pacheco, unpubl. data). Each large bulb produces a robust peduncle supporting a single (rarely two) nectarless flowers. <italic>R. montanum</italic> is partially self-compatible, strongly herkogamous and mostly outcrossing (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Ladd and Arroyo 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Pacheco <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). Elevational tendencies in potential flower longevity measured in pollinator-excluded flowers have been extensively studied by <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Pacheco <italic>et al.</italic> (2016)</xref>. In more normal years, mean potential flower longevity stands at 8.1 days and does not vary with elevation. Some individual flowers have been reported to remain open up to 16 days. However, in dry years, by default, potential flower longevity becomes longer at the higher elevations as result of a plastic shortening of the flower lifespan due to intensive soil drying at lower elevation. Open-pollinated flowers have been reported to remain open 7.7 days (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Ladd and Arroyo 2009</xref>). This exceeds the average realized flower longevity for non-asteraceous species in the central Chilean Andes (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Primack 1985</xref>). Stigmas remain receptive for at least 7 days [<bold>see Supporting Information&#x02014;Figure S1</bold>]. Anthers contain large pollen grains which are easily distinguished on stigmas with a hand-lens (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Ladd and Arroyo 2009</xref>). Flowers are pollinated by <italic>Megachile saulcyi</italic> (Megachilidae) (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Ladd and Arroyo 2009</xref>).

Observations were made on 60 haphazardly selected genets per site in the middle of the flowering season over the same dates. One flower bud was selected per genet. As the flowers opened, we established the first day upon which they received pollen by checking their stigmas with a &#x000d7;40 bright hand lens early in the morning before bees became active. Final sample sizes, discarding damaged flowers, were LOW: <italic>N</italic> = 55; MID: <italic>N</italic> = 57; and HIGH: <italic>N</italic> = 55. Because the main aim was to detect if stigmatic pollen deposition is delayed at higher elevations, individual stigmas were no longer observed once they had received some pollen. To compare pollen dosage levels at different elevations, we visually estimated the amount of pollen deposited on individual stigmas according to the following coverage categories: 1 = no conspecific pollen received, 2 = up to &#x000bc;; 3 &#x0003e; &#x000bc;&#x02013;&#x000bd;; 4 &#x02265; &#x000bd;&#x02013;&#x000be;; 5 &#x02265; &#x000be;. Pollen loads correspond to visits made over a single day. Thus, the amount of pollen recorded provides an estimate of pollen dosage intensity.</p><p>To determine whether pollen deposition ceased progressively later in the flower lifespan with increasing elevation we determined how long open-pollinated flowers remained open. Realized flower longevity was obtained from anthesis and floral senescence dates recorded in the field on the same three sets of 60 flowers. As noted earlier, potential flower longevity in the year of study was reduced at low elevation due to soil drying. Realized flower longevity could also be affected at low elevation if soil drying hastens post-pollination senescence. We therefore also calculated the ratio of realized to potential flower longevity for each site (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), which under flower longevity compensation is expected to increase with elevation.</p><p>The timing of floral senescence following pollination varies among species (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Neill 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">van Doorn 1997</xref>). We carried out complementary hand-pollination experiments (on HIGH and LOW) to determine whether realized flower longevity provides a precise proxy for when stigmatic pollen deposition terminates in a flower. Rapid closure of flowers after ample hand-pollination would indicate flower senescence is strongly pollination-triggered and a high level of precision. On each site, 70 pollinator-excluded flowers (one per genet) were assigned to seven equal-sized groups for pollination on successive days after anthesis. We pollinated stigmas with a mixture of fresh pollen obtained from distant genets. We monitored the pollinator-excluded stigma cohorts until floral senescence. This allowed us to obtain the number of additional days flowers remained open after they had been pollinated.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Data analysis.</title><p>Visitation rates were expressed as the total number of visits per 20 min divided by the total number of flowers observed.

We hypothesized that similar levels of pollen limitation could be maintained over the elevational range on account of our focal species possession of intrinsically long-lived flowers. According to this hypothesis, we expected pollen deposition on stigmas at high elevation to commence and terminate later in the flower lifespan and/or to occur in smaller daily doses. The weight of the evidence points to partial flower longevity compensation of lower visitation rates at high elevation in <italic>R. montanum</italic>. However, such compensation does not translate into a commensurate reduction in overall pollen limitation due to additional qualitative pollen limitation at higher elevations.</p><p>On the lower end of the range we found high visitation rates and a complete absence of pollen limitation. Relative to the lowest site, our highest site experienced a 60 % decrease in visitation rates which was associated with substantial pollen limitation. Visitation rates were exceedingly low, and pollen limitation was very high in the middle of the range. That site turned out to be anomalous due to heavy grazing on the key nectar plant (<italic>Adesmia coronilloides</italic>) of <italic>R. montanum</italic>&#x02019;s main pollinator which significantly lowered bee abundance.</p><p>With total flower longevity compensation of the lower visitation rates on the upper part of the range, we expected supplemental pollination to produce no increase in seed set over the controls. This was evidently not the case. At the other extreme, under no flower-longevity compensation, supplemental pollination should have led to a 60 % increase in seed set over that in the controls. Supplemental pollination on the high site boosted seed set by 53 %. This implies a negligible 7 % reduction in pollination limitation attributable to the flower longevity effect. This estimate assumes that visitation levels on the lower part of <italic>R. montanum</italic>&#x02019;s elevational range are not higher than required for maximum seed set. At present, we have no way of telling whether this assumption is valid. The 7 % estimate, however, assumes flower visitation rates to be the only factor driving pollen limitation in <italic>R. montanum</italic>.</p><p>Our results suggest that some of the pollination limitation at high elevations may reflect qualitative (as opposed to more typical quantitative) pollen limitation caused by the deposition of genetically low-quality pollen on stigmas (cf. <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Ramsey and Vaughton 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">Thomson 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Finer and Morgan 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Aizen and Harder 2007</xref>). We found a general tendency for increased levels of abortion with increasing elevation in <italic>R. montanum</italic>, which is common in alpine species (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000f6;rner 2003</xref>). Of far greater relevance in the present context are the higher levels of abortion in control flowers compared to pollen-supplemented flowers on the two highest sites where <italic>R. montanum</italic> is strongly clonal. Such higher levels of abortion are best explained by geitonogamous selfing on a partially self-compatible plant (cf. <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Cosacov <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Hu <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). Pollen-supplemented flowers would have been less susceptible to receiving genetically low-quality pollen because the pollen used came from distant and likely genetically distinct plants, and hence the lower abortion levels. <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">Wirth <italic>et al.</italic> (2010)</xref> provided good genetic evidence for geitonogamous pollination in the alpine cushion plant <italic>Eritrichium nanum</italic>, a species characterized by large numbers of simultaneously blooming flowers.</p><p>To arrive at the real level of longevity compensation for low visitation rates at high elevations, qualitative pollen limitation must be factored out. When this is done by increasing seed set to equal abortion levels in the control and supplemented flowers (obtained by reducing abortion levels in the controls by 9.5 %), the increase in seed set with supplemental pollination on the upper part of the elevational range decreases from 53 % to 37 %. Accordingly, the estimated buffering effect of long-lived flowers on the lower visitation rates rises to 23 %. Based on these calculations, <italic>R. montanum</italic>&#x02019;s long-lived flowers are seen to partially compensate the 60 % reduction in lower visitation rates at high elevations. However, this not insignificant flower longevity benefit is not immediately obvious because it is strongly masked by apparent qualitative pollen limitation.</p><p>Partial flower longevity compensation of quantitative pollen limitation was also supported by patterns of stigmatic pollen deposition patterns and realized flower longevity. Although pollen deposition tended to begin early on stigmas on the upper end of the range, pollen dosage intensity here was lower. This is not surprising in view of the much lower number of visits received by individual flowers over a day at high elevations, as per the flower visitation rates. High-elevation open-pollinated flowers (realized flower longevity) did indeed remain open for longer than their low elevation counterparts, as was expected under flower longevity compensation. This is consistent with pollination deposition occurring over a larger part of the flower lifespan at high elevation. Flowers that remain open after an initial pollination event, as occurs in <italic>R. montanum,</italic> allow multiple pollinator visits, thereby increasing the number of pollen donors and obtaining the resultant benefits of pollen competition (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Kalla and Ashman 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, although later pollen deposition would have been possible at high elevation, given the dynamics of post-pollination floral senesence in <italic>R. montanum</italic>, realized flower longevity cannot provide a precise answer regarding when pollen deposition ceased in the flower lifespan in the high elevation flowers, nor for that matter in the low elevation flowers.</p><p>Qualitative pollen limitation driven by extensive clonal growth at high elevations in <italic>R. montanum</italic> is one of the more interesting findings coming out of our study. Clonal growth facilitates persistence under suboptimal environmental conditions (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Kudoh <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Erikson and Ehrl&#x000e9;n 2001</xref>). It simultaneously promotes increased attraction of pollinators by providing larger floral displays (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Harder and Barrett 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">Vallejo-Mar&#x000ed;n <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). The last effect should be advantageous for securing mates when visitation rates are low as occurs at high elevation. Such advantages contrast with the disadvantages coming from lower adaptability to changing environmental conditions, and, as seen in <italic>R. montanum</italic>, a propensity for geitonogamous selfing in species with some self-compatibility leading to seed discounting. Stronger clonal growth at high elevations in <italic>R. montanum</italic> would tend to counteract lower fitness due to residual pollen limitation driven by low visitation rates not compensated by flower longevity. However, clonal growth is also expected when environmental conditions are limiting for germination and establishment, as a lack of young plants on the upper part of <italic>R. montanum</italic>&#x02019;s range seems to indicate. These factors would reinforce each other and be conducive to the selection for extensive clonal growth at higher elevations. Overall, in <italic>R. montanum</italic>, the long-term fitness gains of clonal growth in the harsh alpine environment appear to outweigh the seasonal fitness losses coming from quantitative and qualitative pollen limitation combined, to the extent that both sources of pollen limitation are tolerated. Many alpine species are clonal (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Keller and Vittoz 2015</xref>) or form flat cushions (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Aubert <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>) that bear large numbers of synchronously open flowers and thus are susceptible to geitonogamous pollen transfer. Combinations of quantitative and qualitative pollen limitation thus are likely to be common in alpine species and come under distinct guises (cf. Kasagi and Kudo 1993).</p><p>The mean visitation rate recorded on our lower site was about six times the community average reported in the same general area several decades ago (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Arroyo <italic>et al.</italic> 1985</xref>). The central Chilean Andes warmed by about 0.28 &#x000b0;C per decade from 1979 to 2006 (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Falvey and Garreaud 2009</xref>) signifying close to a 1 &#x000b0;C increase in temperature. Are current visitation rates and levels of pollen limitation in <italic>R. montanum</italic> representative of historical levels before the onset of global warming? According to the effect size coming out of the analysis of visitation rates in relation to temperature, a 1 &#x000b0;C temperature increase should have boosted flower visitation rates in <italic>R. montanum</italic> by 19 %. Current levels of pollen limitation thus could be lower than historical levels. Nevertheless, under cooler conditions, in species with long-lived flowers, pollen deposition could have been spread out over a larger portion of the flower lifespan and thereby partially compensate the historically lower visitation rates.</p></sec><sec id="s13"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The much lower visitation rates in the upper part of <italic>R. montanum</italic>&#x02019;s elevational range are only partially offset by its long-lived flowers. The benefits of flower longevity compensation at high elevation are largely obscured by qualitative pollen limitation attributable to the transference of genetically low-quality pollen on large clones which increases the level of pollen limitation over that driven by lower visitation rates. The long-term fitness benefits of clonal growth in the harsh alpine environment appear to outweigh the seasonal fitness losses associated with quantitative pollen limitation to the extent that additional qualitative pollen limitation is tolerated. Overall, the elevational trend in pollen limitation in <italic>R. montanum</italic> is not analogous to that revealed for alpine versus lowland species as per the <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Garc&#x000ed;a-Camacho and Totland (2009)</xref> meta-analysis. Pollination limitation measured appropriately across the entire flowering season and elevational ranges in other alpine species might show a similar departure. Finally, current levels of pollen limitation in alpine and other species might not always represent historical levels before global warming. The latter has implications for understanding traits that avoid pollen limitation, given that what we see today could have evolved under different environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s14"><title>Sources of Funding</title><p>This work was supported by grants Fondecyt 1140541 to M.T.K.A. and ICM-MINECON P05-002 and PBF-23 to the Instituto de Ecolog&#x000ed;a y Biodiversidad.
