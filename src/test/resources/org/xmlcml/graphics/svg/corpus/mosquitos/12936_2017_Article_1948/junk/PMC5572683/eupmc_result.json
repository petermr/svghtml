    "Deficient insulin signaling is a key event mediating diabetic glomerulopathy. Additionally, diabetic kidney disease has been related to increased levels of adenosine. Therefore, we tested a link between insulin deficiency and dysregulated activity of the equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) responsible for controlling extracellular levels of adenosine. In ex vivo glomeruli, high D-glucose decreased nucleoside uptake mediated by ENT1 and ENT2 transporters, resulting in augmented extracellular levels of adenosine. This condition was reversed by exposure to insulin. Particularly, insulin through insulin receptor/PI3K pathway markedly upregulated ENT2 uptake activity to restores the extracellular basal level of adenosine. Using primary cultured rat podocytes as a cellular model, we found insulin was able to increase ENT2 maximal velocity of transport. Also, PI3K activity was necessary to maintain ENT2 protein levels in the long term. In glomeruli of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, insulin deficiency leads to decreased activity of ENT2 and chronically increased extracellular levels of adenosine. Treatment of diabetic rats with adenosine deaminase attenuated both the glomerular loss of nephrin and proteinuria. In conclusion, we evidenced ENT2 as a target of insulin signaling and sensitive to dysregulation in diabetes, leading to chronically increased extracellular adenosine levels and thereby setting conditions conducive to kidney injury."
