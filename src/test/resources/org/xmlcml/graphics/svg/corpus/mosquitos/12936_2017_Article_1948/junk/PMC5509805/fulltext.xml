Fenofibrate is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR&#x003b1;) agonist, which induces the proliferation of peroxisomes in the liver, leading to increases in catalase levels that result in acetaldehyde accumulation at aversive levels in the blood when animals consume ethanol. In these new studies, we aimed to investigate if the effect of fenofibrate on ethanol intake is produced exclusively in the liver (increasing catalase and systemic levels of acetaldehyde) or there might be additional effects at central level. High drinker rats (UChB) were allowed to voluntary drink 10% ethanol for 2 months. Afterward, a daily dose of fenofibrate (25, 50 or 100 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (as control) was administered orally for 14 days. Voluntary ethanol intake was recorded daily. After that time, animals were deprived of ethanol access for 24 h and administered with an oral dose of ethanol (1 g/kg) for acetaldehyde determination in blood. Fenofibrate reduced ethanol voluntary intake by 60%, in chronically drinking rats, at the three doses tested. Acetaldehyde in the blood rose up to between 80 &#x003bc;M and 100 &#x003bc;M. Considering the reduction of ethanol consumption, blood acetaldehyde levels and body weight evolution, the better results were obtained at a dose of 50 mg fenofibrate/kg/day. This dose of fenofibrate also reduced the voluntary intake of 0.2% saccharin by 35% and increased catalase levels 2.5-fold in the liver but showed no effects on catalase levels in the brain. To further study if fenofibrate administration changes the motivational properties of ethanol, a conditioned-place preference experiment was carried out. Animals treated with fenofibrate (50 mg/kg/day) did not develop ethanol-conditioned place preference (CPP).In an additional experiment, chronically ethanol-drinking rats underwent two cycles of ethanol deprivation/re-access, and fenofibrate (50 mg/kg/day) was given only in deprivation periods; under this paradigm, fenofibrate was also able to generate a prolonged (30 days) decreasing of ethanol consumption, suggesting some effect beyond the acetaldehyde-generated aversion. In summary, reduction of ethanol intake by fenofibrate appears to be a consequence of a combination of catalase induction in the liver and central pharmacological effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>fibrates</kwd><kwd>catalase</kwd><kwd>alcoholism</kwd><kwd>treatment</kwd><kwd>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient&#x000ed;fico y Tecnol&#x000f3;gico<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002850</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">FONDECYT 1150850, 11130241</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Comisi&#x000f3;n Nacional de Investigaci&#x000f3;n Cient&#x000ed;fica y Tecnol&#x000f3;gica<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002848</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">ACT1411</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="39"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="7590"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) are the main enzymes involved in ethanol metabolism in the liver. However, catalase also plays an important role in the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde (Handler and Thurman, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1988a</xref>). Catalase is localized mainly in peroxisomes and oxygen peroxide required for its activity is provided via the peroxisomal oxidation of fatty acids (Handler and Thurman, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1988b</xref>). It was reported that oral administration of fenofibrate&#x02014;a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR&#x003b1;) specific agonist&#x02014;to rats increases catalase activity in the liver (Henninger et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Steinberg et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Clouet et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; Arnaiz et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Karahanian et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Furthermore, Karahanian et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) found that fenofibrate reduced daily ethanol intake by 70% in high-alcohol drinking UChB rats and Blednov et al. (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) reported similar findings in fenofibrate-treated mice. It is known that the increase of systemic acetaldehyde concentration generates an aversion to ethanol consumption (Mizoi et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>), and this was the basis for the treatment of alcohol-dependent individuals with disulfiram. Karahanian et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) demonstrated that the administration of fenofibrate to alcohol-drinking rats up-regulates catalase activity in the liver, leading to a higher acetaldehyde concentration in blood which ultimately produces the aversion to voluntary ethanol intake. Accordingly, they found that an oral dose of 1 g ethanol/kg produced a marked increase in blood acetaldehyde in fenofibrate-treated animals.</p><p>An alternative hypothesis also emerged to explain the effect of PPAR&#x003b1; agonists on alcohol intake: these drugs would act in the brain where they change the expression of genes related to reward response, ultimately leading to a reduced ethanol drinking (Blednov et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Accordingly, upregulation of several neuropeptide-coding genes in GABAergic neurons located in the amygdala (an area involved in memory consolidation and conditioning) and the prefrontal cortex (involved in the executive decision) was reported (Ferguson et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Interestingly, upregulation of genes involved in dopaminergic transmission and downregulation of genes involved in glutamate signaling were also found (Ferguson et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), both of which important pathways related to alcohol consumption. There is strong evidence that PPAR&#x003b1; agonists reduce the consumption of another drug of abuse, such as nicotine, decreasing its reinforcing properties in the brain (Melis et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Mascia et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Panlilio et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>); therefore, it is plausible that a similar mechanism is also involved in decreasing ethanol intake.</p><p>In this work, we aimed at contributing to the clarification of the likely mechanisms of action of PPAR&#x003b1; agonists on ethanol intake. Our aim was to study the peripheral (liver) and potential central effects of fenofibrate that determine its capacity to reduce ethanol consumption. Generally accepted paradigms to determine whether a drug can reduce central rewarding properties are to evaluate: (i) the prevention of conditioned place preference (CPP); and (ii) its effects on the consumption of sweet substances such as saccharin (Hajnal et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Selectively bred alcohol-preferring UChB rats were found to consume significantly larger quantities of saccharin solution than their alcohol-avoiding counterparts (Tampier and Quintanilla, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Although a common mechanism for the association between consumption of sweet solutions and ethanol intake has not been identified, this mechanism is likely involved in mediating the rewarding properties of both sweet solutions and ethanol. It has been shown that various drugs of abuse and sweet foods share the ability to increase the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (Di Chiara, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Hajnal et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) suggesting that alcohol and sweet taste may share a common dopaminergic mechanism in mediating their hedonic effects.</p><p>In this study, we administered fenofibrate to alcohol- or saccharin-drinking UChB rats, in order to establish whether the effect of this drug on the reduction of alcohol consumption is due to effects at the central level or to an increase of the aversive properties mediated by acetaldehyde generated in the liver after ethanol consumption. With this aim, we evaluated the effects of fenofibrate administration on: (i) voluntary ethanol intake; (ii) saccharin intake; and (iii) ethanol-CPP in alcohol-preferring UChB rats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Animals</title><p>High-drinker UChB rats derived from the Wistar strain and bred selectively for their high alcohol intake (Mardones and Segovia-Riquelme, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; Quintanilla et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) were used.

At the start of fenofibrate treatment, alcohol-induced CPP was assessed according to the methodology described by Quintanilla and Tampier (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Briefly, animals were placed in boxes with three compartments separated by removable guillotine doors. One compartment is painted black, the other is white and the central compartment is painted gray. The procedure had three phases: preconditioning, conditioning and post-conditioning. In the preconditioning phase, three sessions were conducted 24 h apart to determine the initially non-preferred side of the apparatus for each animal. In each session, rats were placed in the passageway leading to the conditioning chambers for 15 min. The time each rat spent in each chamber was recorded. During the conditioning phase (days 4&#x02013;14), guillotine doors separated the compartments so the rats were confined to one side of the conditioning apparatus. Rats were administered ethanol orally (1 g/kg), placed immediately in their less preferred compartment and left there for 15 min. On alternate days, the animals were administered saline and placed in their preferred compartment. As a result of this conditioning schedule, ethanol has been paired five times with the less preferred compartment. The post-conditioning phase began 24 h after the last conditioning trial: a 15 min choice test was performed with no administrations in which the rats could move freely between the two chambers, and the time spent by each rat in the drug-paired compartment was recorded.

We also showed that fenofibrate treatment produced a 2.5-fold increase in catalase activity in the liver and a 10-fold increase (70&#x02013;95 &#x003bc;M) in blood acetaldehyde levels after animals were administered an oral dose of 1 g/kg ethanol. This excess of systemic acetaldehyde then would produce an aversive effect towards ethanol consumption.</p><p>However, we cannot rule out the possibility that fenofibrate exerts part of its effect at the CNS level (e.g., by altering the preference and/or the hedonistic effect of ethanol). This latter hypothesis was proposed by Ferguson et al. (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), as they found that fenofibrate produced alterations of neuropeptide and dopaminergic gene expression in the amygdala. Indeed, fenofibrate is able to reach the brain (Weil et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Blednov et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). With these antecedents, we had proposed that the reduction of alcohol intake seen after the administration of PPAR&#x003b1; agonists could be a dual phenomenon: (i) PPAR&#x003b1; activation is important in the liver, where an increase in catalase activity leads to blood acetaldehyde accumulation whose aversive effects produce a decrease in alcohol intake; and (ii) PPAR&#x003b1; could have central effects altering neuronal circuits that are important for the ethanol drinking behavior (Karahanian et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In order to determine the contribution of hepatic or/and CNS effects in the reduction of ethanol intake elicited by fenofibrate, we measured alcohol and saccharin intake in UChB rats after administration of fenofibrate (50 mg/kg/day). As it can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, UChB rats voluntary drink ~70 ml of 10% ethanol solution/kg/day. The next after starting the administration of a daily oral doses of 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg fenofibrate, alcohol intake decreased by 60%. This reduced alcohol consumption remained basically constant throughout the 14 days of fenofibrate treatment. This is in total agreement with data we reported in a previous work (Karahanian et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). There were no differences between the three doses of fenofibrate tested. Accordingly, the three doses of fenofibrate tested produced a similar increase in blood acetaldehyde levels after the administration of a dose of alcohol (1 g/kg) to the animals (80&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;M vs. 15 &#x003bc;M in controls; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, while the 25 and 50 mg/kg/day doses did not produce effects on the body weight of the animals, the dose of 100 mg/kg/day produced a decrease in this parameter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). It is possible that this higher dose has caused discomfort, or some type of damage or simply a lower consumption of food in the animals. In any case, it has been reported that in humans only 5% of patients suffer from gastrointestinal discomfort resulting from treatment with fenofibrate (Mahley and Bersot, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>).</p><p>In the case of saccharin-drinking rats, the administration of fenofibrate lowered saccharin consumption by 35% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that a significant part of the effect of fenofibrate on the reduction in ethanol intake could take place at the central level. There is evidence that ethanol and palatable foods (e.g., sweet taste) ingestion share common mechanisms involving &#x003bc;-opioid receptors and dopaminergic transmission in the brain reward system (Di Chiara, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Kelley et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Hajnal et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Tampier and Quintanilla (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) showed that UChB rats (bred for their high ethanol intake) have a higher preference for saccharin intake than UChA rats (low alcohol drinking). Furthermore, a long-term exposure to a 10% alcohol solution containing 0.2% saccharin induced a significant increase in alcohol consumption in UChB rats once saccharin was faded out, whereas alcohol consumption in UChA rats returned to the previous low value (Tampier and Quintanilla, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). In the same line, when UChB rats exposed for 3 months to a free choice between 10% ethanol and water were offered with a third bottle containing 0.2% saccharin, they maintained their levels of ethanol consumption but showing a 2.3-fold increase in their consumption of saccharin solution (Tampier and Quintanilla, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). These results suggest the existence of common neuronal mechanisms determining the rewarding properties of ethanol and saccharin.</p><p>While there is a direct relationship between the activation of PPAR&#x003b1; mediated by fenofibrate with an increased catalase activity in the liver and subsequent aversion to alcohol intake due to increased levels of ethanol-derived acetaldehyde in blood, the connection between PPAR&#x003b1; activation and the decrease in the rewarding properties of ethanol has not a straightforward explanation. PPAR&#x003b1; is expressed throughout the central nervous system, including the midbrain (Cullingford et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) and the nucleus accumbens core and shell (Moreno et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>); this last area is essential for the rewarding properties of many drugs of abuse. Ferguson et al. (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) reported that fenofibrate produces several changes in genes related to synaptic transmission in brain regions relevant to addictive behaviors (amygdala and prefrontal cortex). However, a mechanistic relation between PPAR&#x003b1; activation in the brain and changes in the expression patterns of those genes is still lacking. Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) express nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (Clarke et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>), whose activation lead to an increased dopaminergic activity (Pidoplichko et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). It has been reported that activation of PPAR&#x003b1; induces a yet-unidentified tyrosine kinase(s) which phosphorilates and negatively regulates &#x003b2;2-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, thus decreasing the dopaminergic activity of VTA neurons (Melis et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). According to this, one possibility is that fenofibrate-mediated activation of PPAR&#x003b1; would diminish dopamine release in the mesolimbic system, thus decreasing reward. The effect of fenofibrate at the central level would not be surprising, since it has been described that PPAR&#x003b1; activation leads to a lower consumption of nicotine, due to a decrease of its rewarding properties (Mascia et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Panlilio et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In these studies, PPAR-&#x003b1; agonists dose-dependently decreased nicotine-induced excitation of dopamine neurons in the VTA and nicotine-induced elevations of dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens shell of rats.</p><p>Disulfiram inhibits ALDH2 in the liver, leading to a buildup of acetaldehyde in the periphery when the individual consumes alcohol. This excess of acetaldehyde finally produces aversion to alcoholic beverages. This effect is clearly observed in UChB rats when they initiate their alcohol intake (Tampier et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>); however, when these rats have ingested ethanol chronically, disulfiram although having an identical effect in elevating blood acetaldehyde levels is completely ineffective in reducing ethanol intake (Tampier et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). It is noteworthy that in these studies, acetaldehyde accumulated at even higher concentrations (150 &#x003bc;M) than those achieved in the studies presented here (80&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;M). Similarly, in humans, the success rate of treatment with disulfiram is quite low because many patients do not show aversion to ethanol ingestion and further develop tolerance to disulfiram. Recent placebo-controlled clinical work and meta-analyses also show that disulfiram&#x02014;as a drug (in blind studies)&#x02014;is not different from placebo in reducing ethanol relapse in alcoholics (Skinner et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Yoshimura et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). These studies might be taken as an indication that following chronic ethanol intake a systemic elevation of acetaldehyde does not inhibit ethanol consumption. However, increases in systemic acetaldehyde following the administration of an adenoviral vector (which does not enter the brain) coding for an antisense-RNA that inhibits ALDH2 synthesis or another adenoviral vector that also overexpresses ADH, markedly inhibited (50%&#x02013;65%) voluntary ethanol intake of rats that had ingested ethanol chronically for 60&#x02013;75 days (Ocaranza et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Rivera-Meza et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Rather, the lack of disulfiram effect on ethanol intake in animals fed alcohol chronically (and in alcoholics) may stem from the fact that disulfiram crosses the blood-brain barrier and also inhibits ALDH2 in the brain (Hellstr&#x000f6;m and Tottmar, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>), increasing acetaldehyde levels in this organ. A number of studies have shown that oppositely to its peripherally aversive actions, acetaldehyde possesses reinforcing and stimulating effects in the brain (Rodd et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Thus, in ethanol-fed rats brain disulfiram might contribute an added hedonistic effect of ethanol to counter the aversive effects of acetaldehyde in the periphery. Therefore, in order to find a drug that is more effective than disulfiram in reducing alcohol consumption in patients, this drug should ideally stimulate the production of acetaldehyde in the periphery, and not in the brain. To clarify whether treatment with fenofibrate increases levels of catalase in the brain, we quantified catalase levels by western blot. Clearly, no increase in catalase is observed in the brain after the treatment with fenofibrate. In contrast, levels of catalase in the liver undergo a marked increase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). As fenofibrate induced a reduction on voluntary ethanol intake in chronically drinker rats, we hypothesized that it can also interfere with the development of CPP. In fact, the administration of fenofibrate fully blocked CPP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). It is interesting that fenofibrate was also able to reduce alcohol consumption when it was administered not simultaneously with ethanol (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). In animals that have been consuming alcohol for 60 days, when alcohol was withdrawn and fenofibrate was given for 14 days, a significant decrease in consumption was observed on the following days of ethanol re-access. A second cycle of deprivation/administration of fenofibrate and subsequent re-access to ethanol also showed a decrease in consumption, and this effect lasted longer than in the first cycle (12 days vs. 15 days). These observations have two possible explanations: (i) the levels of catalase in the liver may remain elevated several days after withdrawal of fenofibrate, so that the aversive reaction to peripheral acetaldehyde would continue to occur; or (ii) fenofibrate produced effects at the central level, decreasing the preference for ethanol when it was offered back to the animals. Further experiments are needed to clarify this point.</p><p>One of our concerns was that the co-administration of fenofibrate in conjunction with voluntary alcohol consumption could somehow produce liver damage. Under our experimental conditions, no changes in ASAT and ALAT were detected in the serum of ethanol-drinking fenofibrate-treated animals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Tsutsumi and Takase (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) studied the effect of fenofibrate administration to rats subjected to forced consumption of alcohol (ethanol-containing liquid diet); they observed not only that fenofibrate administered together with ethanol did not produce liver damage, but that some indicators improved (ALAT decreased in serum). In addition, treatment with fenofibrate reverted the hepatic steatosis induced by the consumption of the ethanol-containing liquid diet.</p><p>In summary, fenofibrate produces a 60% decrease in voluntary ethanol intake in high-drinker rats and 35% reduction in saccharin intake. These results suggest that fenofibrate reduces ethanol appetence by a combination of peripherally (aversive) and central effects. Thus, fenofibrate administration can be further explored as a new pharmacological strategy for the treatment of alcoholism.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to the experiments.
