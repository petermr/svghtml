    "Functional recovery after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remains a significant problem. We tested a novel therapeutic approach with long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) to assess the safety and feasibility of an effectiveness trial.We conducted a multicentre, parallel, randomized, open-label pilot trial. Patients admitted within 72 hours after SAH with modified Fisher scale scores of 3 or 4 who were selected for scheduled aneurysm clipping were allocated to receive either n-3 PUFA treatment (parenteral perioperative: 5 days; oral: 8 weeks) plus usual care or usual care alone. Exploratory outcome measures included major postoperative intracranial bleeding complications (PIBCs), cerebral infarction caused by delayed cerebral ischemia, shunt-dependent hydrocephalus, and consent rate. The computed tomography evaluator was blinded to the group assignment.Forty-one patients were randomized, but one patient had to be excluded after allocation. Twenty patients remained for intention to treat analysis in each trial arm. No PIBs (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.00 to 0.16) or other unexpected harm were observed in the intervention group (IG). No patient suspended the intervention due to side effects. There was a trend towards improvements in all benefit-related outcomes in the IG. The overall consent rate was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.78 to 0.96), and there was no consent withdrawal.Although the balance between the benefit and harm of the intervention appears highly favourable, further testing on SAH patients is required. We recommend proceeding with amendments in a dose-finding trial to determine the optimal duration of parenteral treatment."
