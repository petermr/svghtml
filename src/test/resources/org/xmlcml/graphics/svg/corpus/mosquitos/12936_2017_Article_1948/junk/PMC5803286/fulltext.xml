This group of patients has an increased risk of comorbidities, morbidity, and mortality independently of BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Also, the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study demonstrated that CVDs, coronary heart disease (CHD), cancer, and all-cause of mortality improve after surgery compared to those patients with medical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Despite having the major number of patients and follow-up in the existing literature, its conclusions are still controversial as it is a non-randomized trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">In our investigation, we observed that all of our patients with BMI below 35 suffered from different comorbidities such as insulin resistance, T2DM, dyslipidemia, NAFLD, HTN, GERD, hyperuricemia, and hypothyroidism. All of them had made hard efforts with previous medical treatments without sustained success, and surgery gave them the possibility to reach a healthy weight with resolution or remarkable improvement of their comorbidities with statistically significant outcomes.</p><p id="Par42">Diabetes Surgery Summit recommends surgery for diabetic patients with class 1 obesity only in cases where all medical and lifestyle interventions for type 2 diabetes have failed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, on the basis of our results, we think that this statement excludes patients with IR or recently diagnosed T2DM, who presented a remarkable remission rate in our series and could be prevented from reaching an advanced stage of their disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Patients with GERD symptoms submitted to LSG presented an acceptable remission rate, and de novo GERD was low (2.4%) compared to other publications. This is probably because of the detailed and aggressive hiatus inspection during surgery and repair of all the hiatal hernias detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Analyzing weight loss, we found that it was astounding that only 1&#x000a0;month after surgery, all of the patients were out of obesity range with a %TWL of 12.9%. This may be related to the initial BMI that allows reaching a healthy weight earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Also, %TWL and %EWL were achieved at the first postoperative year, even if it declined along the second and third year; a successful weight loss was maintained in a considerable amount of patients during the second and third year after surgery. Analyzing these outcomes, we agree with Ji Yeon Park and Yong Jin Kim when they describe that patients with BMI between 30 and 35 have better EWL and reach a lower BMI than patients with BMI over 35 at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Strengths and Weaknesses</title><p id="Par45">It is an important strength that a large number of patients were included in this study.

Because of this, we had to deal with lack of information and insufficient follow-up, which made us exclude many cases.</p><p id="Par47">Hopefully, further studies would generate the necessary evidence to allow a better patient selection for LSG based on their associated conditions and individual considerations instead of BMI.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par48">Class I obesity is accompanied by many comorbidities that treated in the early stages could avoid becoming more severe.
