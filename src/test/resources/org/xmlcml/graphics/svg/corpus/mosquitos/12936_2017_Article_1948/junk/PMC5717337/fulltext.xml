The aim of this work was to characterize epithelial oral and cervical cancer cells that express HR-HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins. Transcriptomic assay using DNA microarrays revealed that PIR gene expression was detected in oral cells in an HR-HPV E6/E7-dependent manner. In addition, PIR was overexpressed in HPV-positive SiHa and Ca Ski cells, whereas it was undetectable in HPV-negative C33A cells. The PIR expression was dependent on functional HR-HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins even though the E7 oncoprotein had higher activity to induce PIR overexpression in comparison with E6. In addition, using an siRNA for PIR silencing in oral cells ectopically expressing HR-HPV E6/E7, there was a significant increase in E-cadherin transcripts and a decrease in Vimentin, Slug, Zeb and Snail transcripts, suggesting that HR-HPV-induced PIR overexpression is involved in epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, migration of PIR-silenced cells was significantly decreased. Finally, using inhibitors of some specific pathways, it was found that EGFR/ERK and PI3 K/AKT signalling pathways are important for E7-mediated PIR overexpression. It can be concluded that PIR gene expression is highly dependent on the expression of HR-HPV oncoproteins and is important for EMT regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>papillomavirus</kwd><kwd>PIR</kwd><kwd>oral</kwd><kwd>cervical</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondecyt Regular 1130292</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient&#x000ed;fico y Tecnol&#x000f3;gico</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002850</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Conicyt-Fondap 15130011</award-id><award-id>Fondecyt regular 1130292</award-id><award-id>Fondecyt regular 1160889</award-id><award-id>Fondecyt regular 1161219</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>November 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Background</title><p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a non-enveloped, epitheliotropic, double-stranded DNA virus with icosahedral symmetry. More than 200 HPV genotypes have been found and sequenced. Among them, high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) is a group of HPV genotypes (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 52 and 58, among others) that are the causal agents of cervical carcinomas. Furthermore, infection with these viruses has been associated with a significant proportion of anogenital and head and neck carcinomas (HNCs), including oropharyngeal and oral carcinomas [<xref rid="RSOB170111C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="RSOB170111C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Even though the mere overexpression of HR-HPV E6 and HR-HPV E7 oncoproteins is not a sufficient condition for cancer development, the hallmark of HR-HPV-mediated oncogenicity is E6 and E7 overexpression, which is generally caused by HR-HPV integration into the host genome [<xref rid="RSOB170111C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. HR-HPV E6 is a 160-amino-acid protein with two zinc-finger domains, and E7 is a 98-amino-acid protein that shows three conserved regions and only one zinc-finger domain. When HR-HPV-related cancers arise, the tumour cells become addicted to E6 and E7 oncoproteins, because when these oncoproteins are silenced, cells suffer senescence and apoptosis [<xref rid="RSOB170111C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="RSOB170111C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The oncogenic mechanism mediated by HR-HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins is related to the ability of the virus to induce p53 and pRb destabilization with subsequent loss of apoptosis ability and cell cycle control, respectively [<xref rid="RSOB170111C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, HR-HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins interact with many other proteins within epithelial cells for additional alterations [<xref rid="RSOB170111C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Additional E6 partners include transcriptional co-activators, PSD95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain proteins, tumour suppressor proteins and inducers of apoptosis and factors related to DNA replication and repair [<xref rid="RSOB170111C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It has been reported that the HR-HPV E6 oncoprotein induces the expression and activity of hTERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, which is assumed to be responsible for HR-HPV-mediated immortalization. Also, HR-HPV E7 binding to pRb family proteins induces E2F release and overexpression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16. Additional E7 partners are p21 [<xref rid="RSOB170111C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], MPP2 [<xref rid="RSOB170111C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], p48 [<xref rid="RSOB170111C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and p27 [<xref rid="RSOB170111C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], among others. Thus, the overall ability of HR-HPV E6 and E7 for cell immortalization <italic>in vitro</italic> and cancer induction <italic>in vivo</italic> involves a complex network of interactions.</p><p>Even though there is increased knowledge on the alterations caused by HR-HPV interactions in epithelial cells, more information is required concerning molecular changes in HR-HPV associated with oral carcinogenesis when compared with cervical cancer. In this study, we found that pirin, the product of the PIR gene and an oxidative stress sensor, is consistently overexpressed in HR-HPV-associated tumours including head and neck and cervical cancer cells. Moreover, although both HR-HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins are associated with PIR overexpression, E7 has a predominant effect in PIR expression. Finally, we found that HR-HPV-associated PIR overexpression is related to increased migration and epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition (EMT) properties of oral and cervical cancer cells expressing HR-HPV E6 and E7.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1.</label><title>Non-tumour oral epithelial cells express functionally active HPV16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins</title><p>To get new insights into the role of HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncogenes in epithelial oral cells, OKF6&#x02013;Tert2 cells were stably transfected with a vector expressing HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins. Although this vector was designed for retroviral transduction by using appropriate packaging cells, previously published findings demonstrated that transfection is useful for efficient plasmid uptake [<xref rid="RSOB170111C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="RSOB170111C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Geneticin-resistant colonies were selected, pooled and characterized for expression of HPV oncoproteins and associated cellular alterations. These transfected cells, named OKF6HPV-16E6E7, were evaluated for E6 and E7 transcripts and oncoprotein expression using RT&#x02013;qPCR and immunofluorescence (IF), respectively. As expected, these cells efficiently expressed HPV-16 E6/E7 transcripts and protein (as shown in electronic supplementary material, figure S1<italic>a,b</italic>). Most importantly, HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins were biologically functional because it caused p53 and pRb degradation (as shown in electronic supplementary material, figure S1<italic>c</italic>). Moreover, we observed that telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) transcripts were significantly increased (electronic supplementary material, figure S1<italic>d</italic>), supporting the biological functionality of E6 and E7 oncoproteins in OKF6&#x02013;Tert2 cells. In addition, it was demonstrated that oral cells expressing HPV-16 E6/E7- exhibited an increased proliferation rate compared to parental cells or cells transfected with an empty vector (electronic supplementary material, figure S2).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><label>2.2.</label><title>PIR gene is overexpressed in oral epithelial cells expressing HR-HPV E6/E7 in a dose-dependent manner</title><p>In order to determine changes in the levels of mRNAs in OKF6HPV-16E6E7 cells, a transcriptomic approach with DNA microarrays was used (HEEBO, 48.5 K), by which these cells were tested for up- and downregulated genes. It was found that 37 genes were significantly upregulated and 85 genes were downregulated. A heatmap with the most important altered genes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB170111F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref>. We observed that PIR transcripts were strongly upregulated in these transfected cells (score: 2.4). It is known that the PIR gene encodes for pirin, a protein that was reported to be an oxidative stress sensor [<xref rid="RSOB170111C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In fact, pirin is upregulated under tobacco smoke exposition in bronchial cells, and to our knowledge, no previous information has been reported about the relationship between this protein and HPV infection. Therefore, we focused on this protein for subsequent analysis. We confirmed the overexpression of PIR transcripts and pirin protein in OKF6HPV-16E6E7 cells using RT&#x02013;qPCR and western blotting, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB170111F2">figure&#x000a0;2</xref><italic>a,b</italic>. In addition, the overexpression of pirin at protein level was confirmed in Ca Ski and OKF6HPV-16E6E7 cells by using indirect immunofluorescence (IFI). It was observed that Ca Ski cells, that harbour 500 HPV-16 copies per genome, expressed high levels of pirin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB170111F2">figure&#x000a0;2</xref><italic>c</italic>). Next, a dose&#x02013;response effect was analysed using C4I cervical cancer cells, which are HPV-18 positive although with low levels of pirin expression. These cells were transiently transfected with different concentrations of pLXSNHPV16E6E7 plasmids. A dose&#x02013;response effect was observed using vector concentrations ranging from 1 to 4 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB170111F2">figure&#x000a0;2</xref><italic>d</italic>). Thus, we determined viral load dependency in HR-HPV-positive and -negative cervical cancer cells currently available in the laboratory. As expected, it was observed that PIR was overexpressed in a viral load-dependent manner at RNA and protein level in SiHa and Ca Ski cells, harbouring 2 and 500 HPV-16 copies/cell, respectively. However, C33A, an HPV-negative cervical cancer cell line, exhibited almost undetectable levels of pirin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB170111F2">figure&#x000a0;2</xref><italic>e</italic>,<italic>f</italic>). Taken together, these results clearly showed that pirin overexpression is at least dependent on ectopic or endogenous HPV-16 E6 and E7 expression in oral and cervical cancer cells.

After G418 selection, the corresponding pooled colonies were assayed for E6 or E7 transcript expression and protein functionality. Both HPV-16 E6 and E7 transfected OKF6&#x02013;Tert2 cells efficiently expressed the corresponding transcripts and translated oncoproteins were functional, as demonstrated by p53 and pRb downregulation (electronic supplementary material, figure S3). Next, OKF6&#x02013;Tert2 oral cells stably and ectopically expressing HPV-16 E6 or E7 oncogenes were analysed for PIR expression using RT&#x02013;qPCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB170111F3">figure&#x000a0;3</xref><italic>a</italic>, both HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins independently induced PIR transcript expression, although E7 showed the higher activity. In addition, a synergism was apparent because PIR expression was significantly higher when both oncoproteins were expressed. However, when levels of PIR transcripts were normalized against levels of E6 or E7 transcripts, we observed that E7 is more efficient than E6 in inducing PIR expression, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB170111F3">figure&#x000a0;3</xref><italic>b</italic>. To confirm the importance of viral oncoproteins for PIR overexpression, an siRNA for HPV-16 E6 or E7 silencing was used.

We confirmed that these siRNAs can silence E6 and E7 oncogenes in OKF6&#x02013;Tert2 cells at RNA (electronic supplementary material, figure S3<italic>a,b</italic>) and protein levels (electronic supplementary material, figure S3<italic>c</italic>). In fact, both siRNA for HPV-16 E6 and E7 were able to decrease the levels of PIR transcripts in Ca Ski cells, although a higher decrease was observed when an siRNA against E7 was used compared to cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB170111F3">figure&#x000a0;3</xref><italic>e</italic>).

Even though the main molecular mechanisms, such as p53 and pRb destabilization, are hallmarks of HR-HPV-mediated carcinogenesis, more information is required about specific alterations in oral and cervical cancer cells and their relationship with HR-HPV. In this study, using a human whole-genome transcriptomic approach and confirmation by RT&#x02013;qPCR, it was found that PIR was expressed at high levels in oral cells upon ectopic HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncoprotein expression. Also, we showed that this gene was strongly induced in HR-HPV-positive cervical cancer cell lines. However, PIR upregulation is not observed in HR-HPV-negative cervical cancer-derived cell lines. Even though we observed a very significant difference between SiHa and Ca Ski PIR transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB170111F2">figure&#x000a0;2</xref><italic>e</italic>), this difference decreased when we analysed pirin at protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB170111F2">figure&#x000a0;2</xref><italic>f</italic>). Since many regulatory mechanisms are involved between transcription and translation, we cannot deny the possibility that such regulatory mechanisms may be differentially involved in SiHa and Ca Ski cells. For instance, differential epigenetic mechanisms (i.e. microRNAs) or differential factors influencing pirin stability might explain these results. In addition, here we showed that pirin upregulation depends on HR-HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins in Ca Ski cells because when these oncoproteins are silenced, a significant decrease in PIR transcripts was observed. Moreover, we demonstrated that HR-HPV E7 plays a key role promoting PIR overexpression. This is the first study reporting HR-HPV-dependent PIR upregulation in oral and cervical cancer cells. Pirin, the product of the PIR gene, is a small protein composed of 290 amino acids with a molecular mass of 32 kDa [<xref rid="RSOB170111C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that pirin is a non-haeme iron-binding protein that belongs to the cupin superfamily [<xref rid="RSOB170111C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Although PIR is widely expressed in normal and tumour tissues, its function is poorly known. Only recently it was reported that pirin suppresses E-cadherin expression and is involved in the regulation of Snail and Twist expression in HeLa cells, suggesting that pirin is involved in EMT and regulation of cancer metastasis [<xref rid="RSOB170111C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Our results suggest a new pathway for EMT promoted by HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins that is mediated by pirin overexpression. It is widely known that E6 and E7 oncoproteins are involved in EMT directly by downregulating E-cadherin and upregulating vimentin, as well as through transcription factors as Snail, Zeb and Twist [<xref rid="RSOB170111C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="RSOB170111C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, these oncoproteins indirectly regulate EMT through Jagged1 or via FGF2/4 through the PI3 K pathway [<xref rid="RSOB170111C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, the mechanism by which pirin mediates EMT is only partially known. In fact, it was reported that a pirin mutant which was defective for Bcl3 binding was able to decrease the levels of E-cadherin, suggesting that pirin induces EMT independently of Bcl3-Slug signalling [<xref rid="RSOB170111C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Although our findings suggest specific HPV-dependent PIR overexpression, alterations in PIR expression have also been observed in various tumours under conditions of oxidative stress, especially in tobacco smoke-associated cancers [<xref rid="RSOB170111C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="RSOB170111C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this respect, it was previously reported that pirin protein is strongly related to oxidative stress response. Under non-oxidizing conditions, it is considered that this protein resides in the nucleus. However, in some specific conditions related to an increased oxidative stress such as tobacco smoke exposition, activated pirin by oxidized iron-binding works as a positive regulator of NF-&#x003ba;B, which is a family of transcription factors involved in cell growth, survival and immune response that are constitutively activated in cancer [<xref rid="RSOB170111C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It is now clear that HR-HPV E6/E7 oncoproteins modulate NF-&#x003ba;B signalling although remains controversial whether these oncoproteins activate or repress this transcription factor. However, it also appears that NF-&#x003ba;B activation or repression is tissue-dependent [<xref rid="RSOB170111C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Understanding the relationship between HPV and NF-&#x003ba;B activation is crucial, and our findings suggest the existence of a new mechanism mediated by PIR for HR-HPV-dependent NF-&#x003ba;B activation.</p><p>As HR-HPV E7 lacks DNA binding activity, the possibility of a direct PIR promoter activation is unlikely, although we cannot discard the possibility that such activation may occur through some E7 interactions and formation of complexes allowing an increased activity of the PIR promoter. Previously, it was demonstrated that upon MEK1 inhibition, a significant decrease or pirin protein levels was observed in C-JUN transformed human fibroblasts [<xref rid="RSOB170111C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Here, using specific signalling pathways inhibitors, we demonstrated that EGFR/MEK/ERK and probably PI3 K/AKT signalling pathways are important for E7-mediated PIR overexpression in oral cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB170111F4">figure&#x000a0;4</xref><italic>a</italic>,<italic>b</italic>). Thus, these findings suggest an interplay between MAPK and NF-&#x003ba;B signalling pathways during HPV-mediated carcinogenesis in which pirin would be an important mediator. Previously, it was reported that both HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins promote an increase in EGFR transcripts in human keratinocytes [<xref rid="RSOB170111C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], in agreement with the importance of EGFR for E7-dependent PIR upregulation.</p><p>Even though HR-HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins efficiently immortalize epithelial cells, additional alterations are required for complete cell transformation and tumour establishment [<xref rid="RSOB170111C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="RSOB170111C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We previously reported an interplay between tobacco smoke and HR-HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins that increases proliferation and tumour properties in a model of lung epithelial cells [<xref rid="RSOB170111C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As it was reported that PIR is upregulated in bronchial cells after tobacco smoke exposition [<xref rid="RSOB170111C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], it is plausible that pirin may play a role in this process. On the other hand, we previously reported an increase in single- and double-strand DNA breaks in lung cells expressing ectopically HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins exposed to cigarette smoke condensate. Moreover, we observed an increase in &#x003b3;-H2AX phosphorylation [<xref rid="RSOB170111C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Considering the results obtained in this study, it is plausible that an increase in DNA damage and activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) in the presence of HR-HPV is related to pirin increase in oral or cervical cancer cells. Additional studies are necessary to test this possibility.</p><p>To our knowledge, the overexpression of PIR has not been previously reported in transcriptomic or proteomic studies of oral or cervical carcinomas. A recent report analysed 30 primary HNCs in order to identify differentially expressed genes between HPV-16-positive and HPV-negative samples. Results indicated that pirin was not overexpressed in HPV-positive tumours [<xref rid="RSOB170111C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Another study reported up- and downregulated genes in HNCs stratified by HPV presence. Some signalling pathways such as those regulated by NF-&#x003ba;B were found altered, although PIR was not identified [<xref rid="RSOB170111C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. As HR-HPV and tobacco smoke-associated head and neck cancers are different clinical entities, an explanation for these findings is that PIR expression may not be significantly different between tobacco smoke- and HPV-associated HNCs.</p><p>Taken together, our results show that HPV-16 E6/E7 induce pirin expression in oral and cervical cancer cells and that this effect is associated with the expression of EMT markers. These observations suggest that HPV oncogene-mediated pirin overexpression may be important in tumour progression inducing EMT in oral and cervix&#x02013;uterine cancer cells. Considering the findings of this study, a proposed model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB170111F6">figure&#x000a0;6</xref>. The potential value of pirin expression as a surrogate biomarker of HR-HPV in head and neck or cervical cancer warrants additional investigation.
