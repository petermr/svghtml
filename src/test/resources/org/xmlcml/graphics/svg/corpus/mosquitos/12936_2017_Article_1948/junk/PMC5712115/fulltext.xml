Graft vs. host disease (GVHD) is one of the most frequent complications with high morbidity and mortality. First-line treatment with corticosteroids allows to obtain a response rate that varies between 50 and 70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; however patients who did not respond have a poor response rate to second line regimens and have a high mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Extracorporeal photopheresis (EP) has been consolidated in recent years as strategy second line treatment option for corticosteroid-refractory patients, allowing GVHD control in up to 70% of cases with cutaneous involvement with mild immunosuppressive effect and low rates of opportunistic infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Unfortunately, some patients are still refractory to corticosteroids and photopheresis, becoming a therapeutic challenge since no standard treatment has been identified. Ruxolitinib is a janus kinase (JAK1/2) inhibitor designed for the treatment of myelofibrosis, and in comparison with placebo or best available treatment, reduce spleen size and transfusional requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In a murine model ruxolitinib has shown to induce an intense reduction of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, or IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF and other cytokines implicated in lymphocyte activation, which is a distinctive of GVHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. With this background, ruxolitinib has been used in patients with refractory GVHD with overall responses in acute or chronic GVHD of 85 and 25% of complete remission. In this report we show our experience of ruxolitinib use in 8 patients with severe manifestations of acute and chronic GVHD who did not respond to EP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Case presentations</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Case 1</title><p id="Par20">A 54-year-old male was diagnosed with Philadelphia (&#x02212;) acute B lymphoblastic leukemia in 2015.

He received intrathecal methotrexate with FLAGIDA chemotherapy achieving a second complete remission (CR) followed by a haploidentical myeloablative transplant with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI) using peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from a 3/6 HLA matched sibling. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of post transplant cyclophosphamide (days +3 and +4), tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. 1&#x000a0;week post transplantation he developed febrile neutropenia and a progressive hepatic failure. After engraftment on day 12, he developed a progressive respiratory failure and required invasive mechanical ventilation. At day 14 an evanescent rash was noticed and the skin biopsy showed grade 3 aGVHD. Chest CT Scan showed an interstitial pattern of infiltration without images suggesting fungal infection. BAL was performed an all assays were negative (bacterial cultures, CMV PCR, EBV PCR, aspergillus test, no cardial test).

Ruxolitinib 10&#x000a0;mg BID was started and after 3&#x000a0;months of therapy his CT Scan showed a complete remission of lung nodular infiltrates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;7</label><caption><p>Left Pannel shows CT Scan at diagnosis of chronic lung GVHD.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par29">GVHD is a potentially lethal complication after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The absence of response to corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of death. EP has allowed treating patients who do not respond to corticosteroids, with the advantage of being less immunosuppressive as compared to other strategies such as ATG, imatinib, pentostatin, alemtuzumab, rituximab, etc. However, patients who do not respond to corticosteroids and EP are in a very unfavorable situation. Usually these patients have been treated with different immunosuppressive treatments without a consistent response.</p><p id="Par30">Ruxolitinib has emerged in recent years as an excellent strategy for the control of refractory patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Previously, preclinical studies showed that ruxolitinib have a potent immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects with decrease of proinflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. More recently, a cooperative study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] showed a multicentric analysis of 54 patients with aGVHD refractory to corticosteroid treatment and 41 with cGVHD with overall response rate of 81.5% (44/54) in aGVHD including 25 complete responses (46.3%) and an ORR of 85.4% (35/41) in cGVHD, with a low GVHD relapse rate. This outstanding outcomes have also been reported in treatment of sclerotic forms of the disease, a condition that usually has poor response rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Not only in adult transplantation has been reported this remarkable response. Recently a pediatric group showed a 45% overall response in 13 children&#x02019;s with refractory GVHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Based on these encouraging results prospective randomized trials are ongoing in order to confirm the efficacy of ruxolitinib in acute and cGVHD. Also, a new JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor, pacritinib, has recently shown promising results in xenograft mouse models of JAK2V617F-driven diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Likewise, there is a growing interest in developing other JAK pathway inhibitors in GVHD, such as momelotinib, bacritinib and itacitinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, our report is the first to show experience in the use of ruxolitinib in patients refractory or resistant to corticosteroids and EP. In our patients who have received this agent within a compassionate use, an overall response rate of 90% was observed. Another interesting report from our series is that, even in patients with digestive GVHD responses have been observed, despite the doubts regarding the bioavailability of oral drugs in patients with high-flow diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In addition, we observed a favorable response in pulmonary GVHD, the most severe and with the highest mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. So far all of our patients continue to use the drug, with good tolerance and without major adverse effects. Only in two of them was it necessary to adjust the dosage due to haematological toxicity, mainly mild neutropenia, which was recovered when establishing the appropriate dose. Our report shows a satisfactory experience in controlling this serious condition among patients failing to corticosteroids and EP. According to our experience, it could be thought that it is better to use ruxolitinib as a second-line medication for the treatment of refractory GVHD. Randomized studies are necessary to answer this and generate a treatment algorithm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par31">Ruxolitinib has shown a remarkable and hopeful response in patients with GVHD refractory to corticosteroids in recent years. Our report shows that in patients with refractoriness to corticoids and extracorporeal photopheresis also has excellent results with good tolerance and minimal adverse effects, even in difficult cases such as sclerodermiform forms and lung disease.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AML</term><def><p id="Par4">acute myeloid leukemia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ABVD</term><def><p id="Par5">chemotherapy protocol with doxorrubicina, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CR</term><def><p id="Par6">complete remission</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CMV</term><def><p id="Par7">Cytomegalovirus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EBV</term><def><p id="Par8">Epstein Barr virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EP</term><def><p id="Par9">extracorporeal photoapheresis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FLAGIDA</term><def><p id="Par10">chemotherapy protocol with fludarabina, idarrubicin, cytarabine, filgrastim</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GVHD</term><def><p id="Par11">graft versus host disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HyperCVAD</term><def><p id="Par12">chemotherapy protocol with cytarabine, vincristine, doxorrubicin, dexamethasone, methotrexate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICE</term><def><p id="Par13">chemotherapy with ifosfamide, carboplatine, etoposide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL</term><def><p id="Par14">interleukin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IFN</term><def><p id="Par15">interferon</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>JAK2</term><def><p id="Par16">janus kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBSCT</term><def><p id="Par17">peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PET/CT</term><def><p id="Par18">positron emission tomography</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors participated with contributions to the conception of the work; acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of data drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content.
