Importantly, HSV express multiple virulence factors that negatively modulate innate and adaptive immune components. Notably, HSV interfere with dendritic cell (DC) viability and function, likely hindering the capacity of the host to mount effective immunity against these viruses. Recently, an HSV-2 virus that was deleted in glycoprotein D was engineered (designated &#x00394;gD-2). The virus is propagated on a complementing cell line that expresses HSV-1 gD, which permits a single round of viral replication. &#x00394;gD-2 is safe, immunogenic, and provided complete protection against vaginal or skin challenges with HSV-1 and HSV-2 in murine models. Here, we sought to assess the interaction of &#x00394;gD-2 with DCs and found that, in contrast to wild-type (WT) virus which induces DC apoptosis, &#x00394;gD-2 promoted their migration and capacity to activate na&#x000ef;ve CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, DCs exposed to the WT and &#x00394;gD-2 virus experienced different unfolded protein responses. Mice primed with DCs infected with &#x00394;gD-2 <italic>in vitro</italic> displayed significantly reduced infection and pathology after genital challenge with virulent HSV-2 compared to non-primed mice, suggesting that DCs play a role in the immune response to the vaccine strain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dendritic cells</kwd><kwd>HSV type 2</kwd><kwd>glycoprotein D</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>adaptive immunity</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn01">Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient&#x000ed;fico y Tecnol&#x000f3;gico<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002850</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn01">1140011, 1140010</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn02">Comisi&#x000f3;n Nacional de Investigaci&#x000f3;n Cient&#x000ed;fica y Tecnol&#x000f3;gica<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002848</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn02">FONDEQUIP EQM130158, FONDEQUIP EQM-130092</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn03">Ministerio de Econom&#x000ed;a, Fomento y Turismo<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100005886</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn03">Millennium Institute on Immunology and Immunotherapy (P09/016-F)</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn04">International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001688</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn04">CRP/CHI14-01</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="62"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="10476"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infections with herpes simplex viruses (HSV) are common, with two-thirds of the world population infected with HSV type 1 (HSV-1) and nearly 20% infected with HSV type 2 (HSV-2) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Infections are lifelong and virus shedding occurs continuously, both in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Because HSV infections may severely affect healthy and immunocompromised individuals and HSV-2 contributes significantly to HIV epidemics, novel vaccines against these viruses are urgently needed (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Recently, an HSV-2 virus that has the <italic>U<sub>S</sub>6</italic> gene deleted (encoding glycoprotein D, gD) phenotypically complemented by growing the virus on a cell line that expresses HSV-1 gD (VD60 cells) was reported to be safe and immunogenic in mice. The vaccine strain (designated &#x00394;gD-2) conferred complete protection against skin and vaginal challenges with high doses of clinical isolates of HSV-1 and HSV-2 and prevented the establishment of latency (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). An important characteristic of &#x00394;gD-2 is that it is restricted to a single cycle, because progeny do not express gD which is required for viral entry and cell-to-cell spread (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Dendritic cells (DCs) are key immune cells with the capacity to sense, process, and present microbe-derived components to T cells for eliciting cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes and helper T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>), which can support the production of high-affinity antiviral antibodies and exert direct antiviral functions (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Notably, HSV-1 and HSV-2 infect DCs <italic>in vitro</italic> and negatively modulate their maturation, migration, and autophagosome activity and promote their apoptosis (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). These responses may contribute to immune evasion and decrease the host&#x02019;s capacity to establish an effective antiviral response (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesize that &#x00394;gD-2 may differentially affect DC function as compared to wild-type virus (WT) or other single cycle vaccine candidate HSV variants and that these differences may contribute to the immunogenicity of the vaccine. To test this hypothesis, we compared the response of murine DCs to &#x00394;gD-2, a single cycle strain deleted in glycoprotein H (herein &#x00394;gH-2) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), viruses deleted in other non-essential glycoproteins (glycoprotein I and glycoprotein J) and WT virus. When cocultured with T cells, DCs infected with &#x00394;gD-2 activated virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells both, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Animals inoculated with &#x00394;gD-2 in the footpads displayed increased numbers of DCs migrating from the injection site to lymph nodes (LNs) as compared to animals inoculated with the WT virus. Furthermore, animals that received DCs that were inoculated <italic>in vitro</italic> with &#x00394;gD-2 manifested reduced pathology and decreased viral loads in vaginal lavages (VALs) and the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) after genital challenge with a lethal dose of HSV-2. In contrast, the &#x00394;gH-2 virus behaved similarly to the WT virus in DCs, and when mice were treated with DCs infected with &#x00394;gH-2 <italic>in vitro</italic>, a more modest antibody response was observed and the DC immunization conferred only partial protection to the genital challenge with HSV-2. Taken together, these results suggest that &#x00394;gD-2 activates DCs to promote antigen presentation and that this may contribute to the unique immunogenicity and protective capacity of this candidate vaccine strain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Mice were harbored in pathogen-free facilities at the Pontificia Universidad Cat&#x000f3;lica de Chile (Santiago, Chile).

Loss of the <italic>sacB</italic>-hygromycin cassette was verified by PCR with primers LL plus RR (Table S1 in Supplementary Material) for each gene replacement.

One microgram of the mutated HSV-2 BAC DNA, which contains a GFP reporter gene was transfected into Vero cells with Effectene (Qiagen). Two to three days after transfection, plates were screened for green fluorescent virus plaque formation and supernatants from positive wells were overlaid over fresh Vero cells for 1&#x02009;h.

In this case, DCs inoculated with &#x00394;gD-2 displayed significantly higher viability at 24&#x02009;hpi as compared to DCs infected with the WT virus, which induced significant cell death (Figure S1B in Supplementary Material). Furthermore, we evaluated the survival of CD45.1<sup>+</sup> DCs cocultured over WT-, &#x00394;gH-, and &#x00394;gD-2-virus inoculated CD45.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs 24&#x02009;h after infection to determine the effect of DC infection on overlaid bystander DCs. We observed that DCs inoculated with the WT and &#x00394;gH-2 elicited significant death of CD45.1<sup>+</sup> DCs, indicating that their progeny viruses or soluble factors secreted by the corresponding DCs are toxic for accompanying cells (Figure S1C in Supplementary Material). However, this was not the case for DCs inoculated with the &#x00394;gD-2 virus, which did not alter the viability of DCs cultured over previously virus-inoculated DCs. In addition, we tested the capacity of caspase inhibitors to restore the viability of DCs inoculated with WT or &#x00394;gH-2 to assess their functions in subsequent assays. However, DCs inoculated with these viruses in the presence of these drugs succumbed to death, indicating that the mechanism by which HSV-2 kills DCs likely involves multiple pro-death signaling pathways (Figures S1D,E in Supplementary Material).</p><p>To compare the infectivity of &#x00394;gD-2 and WT virus in DCs, we measured HSV-2 proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B) and gene expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C) over a 24&#x02009;h period, after infecting cells with MOI of 1.

However, DCs infected with the WT virus contained increasing viral genome copy numbers over time which peaked at 24&#x02009;h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C), whereas &#x00394;gD-2 and &#x00394;gH-2 virus displayed significantly fewer genome copy numbers which dropped to undetectable levels by 24&#x02009;h post-inoculation.

LPS, a toll-like receptor agonist that induces DC maturation, was included as a positive control. DCs infected with &#x00394;gD-2 displayed a modest increase in some of the maturation markers assessed as compared to DCs infected with WT virus, specifically MHC-I, CD80, and CD86 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). Additionally, we evaluated these maturation markers and CD83 on CD45.1<sup>+</sup> DCs cultured over WT-, &#x00394;gH-, and &#x00394;gD-2-infected CD45.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs 24&#x02009;h after infection to determine the effect of infected DCs on bystander DCs (Figure S2 in Supplementary Material). Under this setting, only DCs infected with the WT virus displayed reduced MHC-I expression. Noteworthy, cytoplasmic ROS production in DCs, which can be used as a marker of DC maturation (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), was transiently increased at 12&#x02009;h post-&#x00394;gD-2 inoculation, which was not observed for DCs infected with the WT virus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). On the other hand, LPS, which was used as a positive control for DC maturation elicited sustained ROS production. Furthermore, we assessed the secretion of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-12, and IL-6 by virally infected DCs. While a modest increase in TNF-&#x003b1; secretion was observed for DCs inoculated with &#x00394;gD-2, the secretion of IL-12 was equivalent among all treatments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). Noteworthy, DCs exposed to &#x00394;gD-2 produced significantly more IL-6 than DCs infected with WT virus. Again, to determine whether increased IL-6 secretion by DCs inoculated with &#x00394;gD-2 was due to a loss of function because of its inability to express gD-2, or to a gain of function due to gD-1 expression, we assessed IL-6 secretion by DCs inoculated with the WT<sup>+gD-1</sup> and &#x00394;gD-2<sup>&#x02212;/+gD-2</sup> viruses.

Two weeks after the last injection of DCs, mice were challenged intravaginally with a 10-fold LD<sub>90</sub> dose of virulent HSV-2 and followed for 11&#x02009;days to determine disease progression and infection. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>A, animals that received DCs inoculated with the abovementioned viruses displayed significant amounts of anti-HSV-2 antibodies, indicating that the transferred DCs were immunogenic. Importantly, mice that received &#x00394;gD-2-infected DCs generated ~10-fold more antibodies against HSV-2 than animals that received DC treated with &#x00394;gH-2 or UV-inactivated &#x00394;gD-2, which may reflect the enhanced survival and/or trafficking to LNs of the &#x00394;gD-2-infected DCs. As expected, animals that were not primed and received control DCs did not generate a significant antibody response. The antibody responses were reflected by the clinical response to viral challenge. Mice primed with virally infected DCs had reduced signs of epithelial and neurological disease and greater survival than controls, which resulted in a significant difference in survival comparing mice that received the &#x00394;gD-2-infected DCs versus the control (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>B&#x02013;D). All (5/5) of the &#x00394;gD-2-DC primed mice survived, whereas all of the mice that received the control DCs succumbed to the infection (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>B&#x02013;D). To follow infection in the genital tract, virus loads were determined in VALs at days 2, 6, and 11 (or at the time of euthanasia) by plaque assay on Vero cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>E, all of the mice injected with &#x00394;gD-2-infected DCs cleared the virus by day 6, compared to only 2/5 mice receiving &#x00394;gH-2 or UV-&#x00394;gD-2-infected and none of the control mice. Because HSV-2 infects neurons in the dorsal root ganglia to establish latency, we assessed viral loads in this tissue at day 11 post-challenge (or at the time of euthanasia) by qPCR. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>F, mice primed with &#x00394;gD-2-infected DCs manifested the lowest loads of virus in this tissue compared to the other groups. Finally, as expected animals that received untreated DCs manifested the highest viral loads in the genital tract and neurological tissue (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>E,F). Taken together, these data suggest that DCs are capable of priming an immune response and the differential response of DCs to infection by &#x00394;gD-2 compared to &#x00394;gH-2 or WT virus may contribute to vaccine efficacy in this model.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Transfer of dendritic cells (DCs) infected with &#x00394;gD-2 confer protection against intravaginal lethal challenge with HSV type 2 (HSV-2).

Identifying how HSV interferes with DC function and promotes their death, may provide valuable insights for establishing protective immunity against these viruses (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). &#x00394;gD-2 was restricted to a single cycle in DCs, similar to what has been described in other cell types, but in contrast to WT virus, did not induce cell death. Remarkably, &#x00394;gH-2, which is also a single cycle virus behaved more like the WT virus and induced DC death. Noteworthy, a &#x00394;gH-2 viral strain was not effective in a therapeutic vaccine clinical trial (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Because WT virus propagated on VD60 cells (WT<sup>+gD-1</sup>) and &#x00394;gD-2 propagated on ET60 cells (gD-2<sup>&#x02212;/+gD-2</sup>) displayed similar phenotypes as their counterparts that express gD-2 and gD-1, respectively it is possible that newly synthesized gD-2, which is present in all the other viral strains may play a role in promoting DC death and dampening DC function. Overall the interaction between &#x00394;gD-2 and DCs resulted in modest DC maturation, IL-6 was significantly increased after virus inoculation. IL-6 modulates the effector functions of numerous immune cells, either indirectly through the stimulation of acute phase responses (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) or directly by inducing, for example the differentiation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells into cytotoxic T cells (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), promoting T follicular helper cell differentiation (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), or inhibiting TGF-&#x003b2;-induced Treg differentiation (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), among others. Interestingly, a previous study reported significant IL-6 secretion by cells that were inoculated with an HSV-2 virus that had mutations in the gD region that engages HVEM, suggesting that gD might interfere with intracellular signaling events that lead to the secretion of this cytokine (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The absence of newly synthesized gD and the restriction to a single round of infection may allow DCs to sense the virus and mount an antiviral response capable of limiting its deleterious effects.</p><p>An important aspect of the &#x00394;gD-2 virus is that its progeny does not express gD and thus are incapable of infecting other cells, such as bystander DCs in culture and T cells. This characteristic of this gD-mutant contrasts with WT HSV, which exerts inhibitory effects over T cells, by interfering with receptor signaling events and induces apoptosis (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Additionally, gD <italic>per se</italic> (from HSV-1) has been reported to negatively modulate T cell proliferation, and thus, deleting this protein from the surface of DCs would likely alleviate some of the negative effects that gD has on T cells, if also applicable to gD-2 (gD from HSV-2) (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Consistently, CD45.1<sup>+</sup> DCs cultured over &#x00394;gD-2-inoculated DC were viable, unlike DCs cultured over similar cells infected with WT virus. These results also indicate that DC inoculation with &#x00394;gD-2 does not impact the viability of bystander cells. Importantly, &#x00394;gD-2- inoculated DCs activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that displayed a Th1 phenotype, which contrasted with the Th2-like response observed for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells cocultured with WT virus-inoculated DCs. Previous reports propose that Th1 responses are likely optimal for HSV control in the mouse model and humans (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), so it is noteworthy that a Th1-like antibody response was observed in &#x00394;gD-2 vaccinated mice (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Although gD from HSV-1 has been reported to localize at several cellular compartments and to play a role in virus egress (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), our TEM images of virus-inoculated DCs overall revealed important similarities in the morphology of the defective viral particles released by WT- and &#x00394;gD-2-virus-inoculated DCs and only differences in the frequency of a viral particle phenotype with alterations in the usually electron-dense core were observed. Importantly, qPCR quantification of viral genome content in the viral particles released by the &#x00394;gD-2-inoculated DCs revealed that these structures were mostly devoid of viral genetic material, suggesting that gD may play a role in the assembly of viral particles released by immune cells. Noteworthy, it is likely that reduced viral genome content in the viral fractions collected from the ultracentrifugated supernatants of &#x00394;gD-2-inoculated DCs was not due to reduced viral particle release by these DCs, as ICP5 a major HSV-2 capsid protein was abundantly detected in the viral particles recovered from these cells. However, we cannot rule out alterations in the amount of ICP5 expressed by the viral particles released by each of the treated DCs, which may account for the reported observations. These results and those from previous reports call for more detailed studies on the role and localization of gD-1 and gD-2 within immune and non-immune cells, as well as for studying the mechanism of exit of these non-enveloped particles from DCs.</p><p>Because the replication cycle of the &#x00394;gD-2 virus may differ from that of the WT virus in modulating RER stress, we sought to evaluate UPRs in DCs inoculated with these viruses. As expected, the PERK response in DCs was similar for the WT and &#x00394;gD-2 viruses, as both viruses express gB, which has been reported to be involved in modulating this pathway (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). However, an unexpected finding was the observation that, compared to &#x00394;gD-2, the WT virus induced increased XBP-1 mRNA splicing in DCs. This result differs from that observed in a previous study with epithelial cells and HSV-1, in which no significant UPR response was observed after infection with the WT virus, suggesting that the UPR response differs depending on the cell type infected with HSV and possibly between HSV-1 and HSV-2 (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Importantly, an increase in XBP-1 mRNA splicing has been previously associated with decreased cell viability in cells infected with the human cytomegalovirus (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), which overall decreases MHC-I presentation (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Hence, the increase in XBP-1 mRNA splicing observed herein with the WT virus may contribute to increased DC mortality and reduced antigen presentation to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. It will be relevant to assess whether this UPR pathway is involved in HSV-mediated DC death, together with other previously proposed mechanisms (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Moreover, interfering with the HSV-1 &#x003b3;34.5 protein, which modulates the PERK UPR response by inhibiting eIF2-alpha phosphorylation and the beclin-1 autophagy pathway (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), was recently reported to produce an attenuated virus in DCs that conferred protective immunity against challenge (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Thus, modulating the UPR response in DCs infected with HSV can promote cell survival and the induction of effective antiviral adaptive immunity.</p><p>Importantly, HSV infection interferes with the migration of Langerhans cells from the skin to LNs and induces their apoptosis (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, dDCs can capture apoptotic Langerhans cells and relay virus antigens to the LNs for activating CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Here, we observed that subcutaneous injection of &#x00394;gD-2 promoted DC migration to the draining LNs and that these migrating cells displayed a mature phenotype. Furthermore, &#x00394;gD-2 inoculation promoted the relocation of migrating CD103<sup>+</sup> dDCs to the LNs, which are known to be effective at cross-presenting antigens (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Importantly, the &#x00394;gH-2 virus did not promote significant relocation of DCs after subcutaneous inoculation. Furthermore, &#x00394;gD-2 inoculation resulted in an increased early activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, likely by CD103<sup>+</sup> dDCs.
