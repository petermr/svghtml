    "AbstractBackgroundThe HIV epidemic reached Chile in the mid 1980s, as response a national AIDS commission was created, AIDS care centers were organized (Fundacion Arriaran [FA] was the first) and free antiretroviral therapy (ART) was later provided with progressive coverage, complexity and availability over the years Objective. Quantify evolution of mortality, retention and abandonment (LTFU) over 25 years according to qualitatively different periods in the national program of access to ART, from no availability to full coverage with current drugs at FA centerMethodsRetrospective analysis of FA updated database of the 5080 adult patients admitted from 1990 to 2014, who were distributed in 4 groups: A: no ART availability (1990–92); B: mono/dual ART (1993–98); C: early modern ART (HAART) (1999–2007) and D: contemporary HAART (2008–14). Mortality, Retention and LTFU were evaluated at 1, 3, 5 and 10 year intervals from admission and at end of 2015. Mortality was included in period of occurrence; LTFU was permanent absence at center of > 6 months during studied period. Local IRB approved the studyResultsMain results shown in Table. Mortality varied from 40% to 2%, and 62% to 7% at 1 and 5 years, for groups A and D respectively; 72% to 16% at 10 years for groups A and C, respectively. Retention at 5 years were 28%, 32%, 72% and 77% for groups A, B, C and D respectively. LTFU was 10%, 17%, 12% and 10% at 5 years for same groups, respectively. At 12/2015 6%, 19%, 61% and 84% from groups A, B, C and D, respectively, remained retained in careMortality (M) Retention (R) and Abandonment (Ab) in %Year 1Year 3Year 5Year 10Dec 2015MRAbMRAbMRAbMRAbMRAb A n 330No ARV available (1990–92)405554845762281071141475615 B n 882Pre HAART therapy (1993–98)29619453914503217542619571920 C n 1690Early HAART (1999–2007)78479781013721216*63*14*176114 D n 2178Contemporary HAART (2008–14)291458387*77*10*4846Mortality, retention and abandonment according to periods of admission and at end of 2015, in %.*Calculated with proportion of patients completing that period.Transfers: 0–8% for each period.
