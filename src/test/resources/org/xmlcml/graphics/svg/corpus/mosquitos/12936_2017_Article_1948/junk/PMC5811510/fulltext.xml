Recent analyses revealed a high genomic plasticity of this species, harboring a variety of mobile genetic elements associated with virulent strains, encoding proteins of unknown function whose possible role in pathogenesis have not been addressed. <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> virulence has been studied mainly in animal models such as mice and pigs, however, practical, financial, ethical and methodological issues limit the use of mammal hosts. Consequently, the development of simple and cost-effective experimental approaches with alternative host models is needed. In this work we described the use of both, the social amoeba and professional phagocyte <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> and the fish <italic>Danio rerio</italic> (zebrafish) as surrogate host models to study <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> virulence. We compared three <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> clinical isolates evaluating their resistance to phagocytosis, intracellular survival, lethality, intestinal colonization, and innate immune cells recruitment. Optical transparency of both host models permitted studying the infective process <italic>in vivo</italic>, following the <italic>Klebsiella</italic>-host interactions through live-cell imaging. We demonstrated that <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> RYC492, but not the multiresistant strains 700603 and BAA-1705, is virulent to both host models and elicits a strong immune response. Moreover, this strain showed a high resistance to phagocytosis by <italic>D. discoideum</italic>, an increased ability to form biofilms and a more prominent and irregular capsule. Besides, the strain 700603 showed the unique ability to replicate inside amoeba cells. Genomic comparison of the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains showed that the RYC492 strain has a higher overall content of virulence factors although no specific genes could be linked to its phagocytosis resistance, nor to the intracellular survival observed for the 700603 strain. Our results indicate that both zebrafish and <italic>D. discoideum</italic> are advantageous host models to study different traits of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> that are associated with virulence.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hypervirulent <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic></kwd><kwd>intracellular survival</kwd><kwd>resistance to phagocytosis</kwd><kwd>host-pathogen interactions</kwd><kwd><italic>Danio rerio</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="93"/><page-count count="20"/><word-count count="15745"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacterial pathogens are currently a major concern for public health, mainly due to the development of multiresistant strains, the tardy development of new effective antimicrobials or alternative methods to control infections, and the rising of hypervirluent phenotypes. Among them, the Gram-negative bacilli <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> was declared by several international healthcare organizations as an &#x0201c;urgent threat to human health,&#x0201d; and represents the &#x0201c;K&#x0201d; of the &#x0201c;ESKAPE&#x0201d; pathogens, the six most significant and dangerous causes of hospital-acquired multiresistant infections (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.A. 2013; UK Department of Health and Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, 2013). Additionally, although <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> has been traditionally considered as an opportunistic pathogen causative of hospital-acquired infections, an increasing number of community-acquired invasive <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> infections are being reported globally. They are presented mainly in the form of pyogenic liver abscesses that are often accompanied by severe metastatic infections such as meningitis, necrotizing fasciitis and osteomyelitis (Siu et al., <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Struve et al., <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Prokesch et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Several factors have been associated to <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> pathogenesis, which contribute to enhance invasiveness, overcome host defenses, and resist antimicrobial chemotherapy (recently reviewed in Clegg and Murphy, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Paczosa and Mecsas, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Among them are the lipopolysaccharide and the O antigen, providing serum resistance; siderophores such as aerobactin and salmochelin, which scavenge iron in environments where it is scarce (as in mammal's fluids); type 1 and type 3 fimbriae involved in biofilm formation and tissue colonization; and a wide repertoire of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases, conferring resistance to the majority of beta-lactams and carbapenems antibiotics. One of the most studied <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> virulence determinant is the thick polysaccharide capsule that surrounds the organism (also called K antigen), which confers resistance to antimicrobial peptides, binds to and neutralizes K antigen-specific antibodies, and mediates resistance to phagocytosis by human neutrophils and macrophages (Simoons-Smit et al., <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Domenico et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Campos et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). It also plays a role in biofilm formation (Balestrino et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), in establishing infection and activating host immune responses (Lawlor et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), and in facilitating intestinal colonization (Favre-Bonte et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Non-capsulated <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains are significantly less virulent than isogenic encapsulated strains in mouse models (Paczosa and Mecsas, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Moreover, hypervirulent strains commonly have a hypermucoviscous phenotype, producing a thick capsule formed by a mucoviscous exopolysaccharide. Notably, K1 and K2 capsule types are the most associated with hypervirulent strains, and with an increased resistance to phagocytosis and intracellular killing by alveolar macrophages and neutrophils (Li et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In addition, although <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> is classically defined as an extracellular pathogen, it was recently reported that an isolate of this species could survive within macrophages in a vacuolar compartment, triggering apoptotic pathways and avoiding delivery to lysosomes (Cano et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, further studies must be performed to corroborate these findings, and to identify the bacterial determinants behind such intracellular survival. Moreover, additional studies are needed to understand the molecular basis of the hypervirulent phenotype.</p><p>The study of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> virulence has been performed classically in animal models such as mice, rats, and pigs (Clegg and Murphy, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Paczosa and Mecsas, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, the use of mammalian hosts are limited by: (1) the need of costly facilities for their maintenance and manipulation, (2) the restricted possibilities for real-time analyses, (3) the need of invasive sample acquisition, and (4) ethical and practical restrictions. As an alternative, simple host models such as the wax moth <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic>, the worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the soil amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> and the fish <italic>Danio rerio</italic> (zebrafish) have been successfully employed for studying pathogenesis of different bacterial species, as well as in the screening for and testing of antimicrobial or anti-virulence drugs (reviewed in Bozzaro and Eichinger, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Meijer and Spaink, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Glavis-Bloom et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Each of these phylogenetically distant organisms possess particular advantages and limitations as model hosts. Moreover, studying the interactions of a given pathogen with each of them provides largely complementary points of view of its virulence potential in different infection contexts and environmental conditions. Recent works used <italic>G. mellonella</italic> to characterize different <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> virulence factors including Lipid A and capsular type determinants, as well as its interactions with the host immune system (Insua et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Wand et al., <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Mills et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Also, <italic>G. mellonella</italic> has been used to test the efficacy of antimicrobial agents against carbapenemase-producing strains of this species (McLaughlin et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Wei et al., <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Similarly, <italic>C. elegans</italic> model have been employed to study the contribution of distinct factors such as efflux pumps and other outer membrane proteins on <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance (Srinivasan et al., <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Lavigne et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Bialek-Davenet et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In this work, we further exploited the advantages of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and zebrafish larvae as host models to develop new assays for studying <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> pathogenesis.</p><p><italic>D. discoideum</italic> is a soil-borne amoeba that feeds on environmental bacteria by phagocytosis. Therefore, it can be a natural host of opportunistic bacteria and thus has developed strategies to avoid invasion by given pathogens or to counteract their intracellular survival and replication (Cosson and Soldati, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Clarke, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). As a professional phagocyte, it can be infected with different bacterial pathogens, and relevant virulence factors in mammals have been shown to be important in the interaction with this amoeba. Also, this organism is easy to grow and maintain in the laboratory, allowing the study of cellular processes with a variety of available genetic and biochemical tools. In addition, the existence of online resources like dictyBase permits easy access to genomic data and biological material such as plasmids and mutant strains (Kreppel et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Basu et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Fey et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Consequently, this amoeba has been successfully used as a model to study virulence and the associated host response in different bacterial species, including <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (Cosson et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Bravo-Toncio et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), <italic>Salmonella</italic> (Sillo et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Riquelme et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), <italic>Legionella</italic>, and <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> (reviewed in Steinert, <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Moreover, <italic>D. discoideum</italic> has been used to identify host factors required for sensing and intracellular killing of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> by phagocytic cells (Lima et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Leiba et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Also, it allowed investigating the role of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> surface structures on its interaction with phagocytes (March et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and to identify factors associated with resistance to phagocytosis in the hypervirulent strain NTUH-K2044 (Pan et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). These studies support the relevance of exploring new assays to better exploit the <italic>D. discoideum</italic> model to investigate <italic>Klebsiella</italic>-host interactions.</p><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) is a vertebrate host model that harbors a mammalian-like innate immune system, and thus has been widely used for the study of host-pathogen interactions and the associated immune response (Kanther and Rawls, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Transgenic zebrafish lines with fluorescently-labeled macrophages and other leukocyte populations allow non-invasive live-cell imaging during the optically transparent early life stages, thus enabling direct, real-time examination of the host response to infection (Renshaw et al., <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In previous work, we successfully used zebrafish larvae to study intestinal colonization and lethality by <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium, using two methods of infection: static immersion and microinjection (Varas et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2017a</xref>,<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). In this regard, a recent work used adult zebrafish to test the safety and the efficacy <italic>in vivo</italic> of molecules with antibacterial activity against multiresistant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, indicating that this pathogen can infect zebrafish when administered by intramuscular injection (Cheepurupalli et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). However, it remained unknown if <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> can infect zebrafish in its larval stage, which harbors advantageous features compared to adult zebrafish as a host model, permitting live-cell imaging of the infection, an easier manipulation of the individuals, and larger population sizes that allow more robust statistical analyses.</p><p>Here, we exploited both the <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and zebrafish larvae host models to study virulence-related traits of three relevant clinical isolates of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>: ATCC 700603, ATCC BAA-1705, and RYC492. <italic>Kp</italic> 700603 is a multiresistant isolate obtained from urine at the Medical College of Virginia (Richmond, USA) in 1994 (Rasheed et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). It was the first <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strain identified that carries the SHV-18 extended-spectrum &#x003b2;-lactamase and it is used as a positive standard for antibiotic resistance mediated by this kind of enzymes. <italic>Kp</italic> BAA-1705 is another multiresistant strain isolated from urine in USA (2007), which is used as a standard for the production of KPC-2 carbapenemase. <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492 is a clinical isolate of fecal origin found in a screening of microcin-producing strains performed at the Microbiology Department at the Centro Especial Ramon y Cajal in Madrid (Asensio et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>; de Lorenzo et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>). This strain produces microcin E492 (MccE492), a bacteriocin with toxic activity against members of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, antitumorigenic properties, and which forms amyloid fibers modulating its toxicity (Lagos et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Marcoleta et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2013a</xref>). Determinants for production of MccE492 along with salmochelin-like siderophores are encoded in a genomic island found to be highly prevalent among hypervirulent <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> isolates (Marcoleta et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Our proposed assays using <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and zebrafish larvae as host models allowed us to evaluate and compare relevant virulence-related traits among these <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains, including resistance to phagocytosis, intracellular survival, intestinal colonization, neutrophil recruitment and lethality. Complementation of these results with genomic and simple microbiological characterizations allowed us to observe striking differences in the virulence strategies between different strains of this species, pointing to the capsule as a major determinant for the pathogenesis in these surrogate models, as it was observed in mammalian host models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains, plasmids, and growth conditions</title><p>The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. <italic>K. pneumoniae, K. aerogenes</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5&#x003b1; strains were routinely grown at 37&#x000b0;C with shaking (180 rpm) in Luria-Bertani broth (10 g/L triptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 5 g/L NaCl) until late-exponential phase of growth. <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ATCC 700603 and ATCC BAA-1705 were kindly provided by Dr. Roberto Vidal from Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile.

Zebrafish larvae (3-dpf) were anesthetized with 4.2% tricaine and mounted on 1% low melting point agarose. The zebrafish were kept under anesthesia during the whole injection procedure. 1&#x02013;5 nL (15,000&#x02013;18,000 CFU) were injected in the circulatory system via the caudal artery (to evaluate survival), or in the otic vesicle (to evaluate neutrophil recruitment and bacterial burden). To determine the CFU injected, the droplets were also diluted in sterile PBS and plated on LB-agar. Infected larvae were transferred into 6-well plates containing fresh E3 medium and kept at 28&#x000b0;C for 72 h. Death events were quantified every 24 h, and survival curves were constructed and analyzed by means of the Kaplan-Meier method using the GraphPad Prism 6.0 software.

Subsequently, each image was processed by quantifying the fluorescence intensity from the red channel (mCherry-labeled bacteria) and green channel (EGFP-labeled neutrophils) (ImageJ software). The region used to quantify the fluorescence was defined as the total area corresponding to the otic vesicle, which can be easily distinguished from bright field images of the larvae.

The progression of the infection was monitored until 96 h post-exposition (hpe). Immersion experiments were performed in a total of 6 independent replicates, using a total of 75 larvae per bacterial strain. The progression of infection and bacterial colonization was monitored through live-cell imaging using an Olympus MVX10 fluorescence stereomicroscope at 48, 72, and 96 hpe. Photographs of the larvae are presented with a total magnification of 12X. To evaluate intestinal colonization, the gastrointestinal tract of the larvae was divided arbitrarily into three segments: anterior, middle and posterior. Four qualitative degrees of intestinal colonization were established based on the fluorescent signal observed under stereomicroscope: (0) no colonization, (1) low colonization, (2) intermediate colonization, and (3) high colonization. The total intestinal colonization score of each individual was calculated as the sum of the scores observed in each segment of the intestine, in a scale ranging from 0 to 9.</p></sec><sec><title>Capsule staining</title><p>Capsule staining was performed as described previously (Breakwell et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).

Two of them, ATCC 700603 and ATCC BAA-1705, correspond to the standard <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> multiresistant strains producing the KPC-2 carbapenemase and the SHV-18 extended-spectrum &#x003b2;-lactamase, respectively. The third strain, RYC492, carries a genomic island found to be highly prevalent among hypervirulent <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> isolates (Marcoleta et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Although all three described strains have sequenced genomes (Broberg et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Marcoleta et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2013b</xref>; Elliott et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), to our knowledge no previous studies assessed experimentally their virulence potential.</p><sec><title>Using <italic>D. discoideum</italic> social development cycle to evaluate <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> virulence</title><p>As a first approach to exploit <italic>D. discoideum</italic>-<italic>Klebsiella</italic> interactions in the study of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> virulence, we adapted a social development assay previously described in a screening for <italic>Pseudomonas aueruginosa</italic> antivirulence compounds (Bravo-Toncio et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This assay is based on that virulent bacteria delay the completion of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> social development, while attenuated or non-pathogenic bacteria allows its rapid conclusion (normally within 2&#x02013;3 days in our experimental conditions). Thus, assessing the effect of a given bacterial strain over the social development is a way to estimate its virulence. Consequently, we compared the effect of feeding <italic>D. discoideum</italic> with the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains RYC492, 700603 and BAA-1705 over the social development of the amoeba. Additionally, <italic>Klebsiella aerogenes</italic> DBS0305928 was included as non-pathogenic control, since this strain is routinely used as a food to support <italic>D. discoideum</italic> growth in laboratory conditions (Fey et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). To this end, 24-well plates containing N agar were inoculated with the different strains and incubated overnight at 23&#x000b0;C to allow the growth of a thin bacterial lawn, which was of a similar prominence in all the strains tested (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1A</xref>). Moreover, the three <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains showed a similar growth in N broth at 23&#x000b0;C (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1B</xref>), indicating that a comparable number of bacterial cells are present in the lawn formed by each strain before inoculating amoeba cells. Then, ~1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>
<italic>D. discoideum</italic> cells were deposited over the bacterial lawns and incubated at 23&#x000b0;C for several days, monitoring the progress of the social development, which involves mainly three consecutive stages: aggregation, elevation and culmination (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The completion of the cycle is characterized by the formation of multiple spore-containing fruiting bodies, such as those observed normally after 2&#x02013;3 days when amoebae were fed with <italic>K. aerogenes</italic> DBS0305928 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,C</xref>). At day 1, amoebae fed with <italic>K. aerogenes</italic> showed a complete phagocytosis plaque (where the whole bacterial lawn inside was engulfed), with aggregating cells forming early multicellular forms in the center. In contrast, incomplete phagocytosis plaques were observed after feeding amoebae with <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> 700603 and BAA-1705 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). However, in the following days, no differences in the cycle progression were observed between these strains and the control (culminating between 2 and 3 days), indicating that <italic>Kp</italic> 700603 and <italic>Kp</italic> BAA-1705 are mildly virulent for <italic>D. discoideum</italic>. Conversely, <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492 showed a highly virulent phenotype causing a delay in the cycle, where at day 1 no clear phagocytosis plaque was observed, and the early elevation phase was reached after 3 days of co-incubation. Noteworthy, the fruiting bodies and earlier multicellular structures formed by amoebae fed with any of the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains tested showed an abnormal morphology. We observed mainly structures with an increased size, such as thicker stems and a bigger sorus, compared with that observed when fed with <italic>K. aerogenes</italic>. This suggests that <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> somehow affects <italic>D. discoideum</italic> multicellular morphological plan, and that this could be further exploited as an additional read-out in this kind of virulence assays. Taken together, these results indicate that social development assays are a useful and straightforward way to compare virulence among distinct <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Use of the <italic>D. discoideum</italic> social development assay to evaluate <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> virulence. <bold>(A)</bold> Main stages of the <italic>D. discoideum</italic> social cycle, which culminates with the formation of the fruiting bodies.

Thus, we adapted the previously described assays using vegetative <italic>D. discoideum</italic> cells, to evaluate the invasiveness and intracellular survival of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains. For this purpose, we co-incubated both organisms during 1 h to let amoebae feed on bacteria. Then, amoeba cells were washed to remove most of bacteria from the medium, and incubated at 23&#x000b0;C.

To this end, a similar experiment was performed using <italic>D. discoideum</italic> cells expressing a calnexin-GFP protein fusion (M&#x000fc;ller-Taubenberger et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), along with bacteria constitutively expressing the red fluorescent protein mCherry from plasmid pFCcGi-TMP. The interaction of intracellular bacteria and amoebae was monitored at 0, 1.5, 3, 6, and 24 h post-infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">2</xref>). In agreement with the bacterial count, a large number of red fluorescent bacteria were detected within amoeba after 1 h co-incubation with <italic>Kp</italic> 700603, <italic>Kp</italic> BAA-1705, and <italic>K. aerogenes</italic> DBS0305928, indicating that all these strains were rapidly internalized by <italic>D. discoideum</italic>. In the case of <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492, a notably smaller number of bacteria was detected at this time, which correlated with the low percentage of internalization measured for this strain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In all the following time points, very few or no <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492 cells were detected in association with amoebae. Intracellular <italic>Kp</italic> BAA-1705 and <italic>K. aerogenes</italic> DBS0305928 were observed only until 3 h after the removal of the extracellular bacteria. In contrast, intracellular <italic>Kp 700603</italic> cells were observed at every time point evaluated. In fact, we were able to detect bacteria within <italic>D. discoideum</italic> after 24 h of co-incubation. These observations confirmed that <italic>Kp</italic> 700603 is able to survive and replicate intracellularly in <italic>D. discoideum</italic>.

To further investigate this possibility, we adapted the infection assay using axenic <italic>D. discoideum</italic> cultures described above. In this version, we allowed amoebae and bacteria to interact during the whole 24 h-period monitored. At distinct times, aliquots of the mixed cultures were obtained and mounted for microscopic observation, and the viable extracellular bacteria were titrated. This was performed centrifuging the aliquots at low speed to sediment <italic>D. discoideum</italic> cells along with intracellular bacteria, and then diluting and plating the supernatant. Although with different kinetics, phagocytic activity of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> caused the reduction over time in the viable count of all the tested bacterial strains except for <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492, which remained constant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). As expected, <italic>D. discoideum</italic> rapidly phagocytized <italic>K. aerogenes</italic> DBS0305928. On the other hand, <italic>Kp</italic> BAA-1705 and <italic>Kp</italic> 700603 extracellular bacteria showed a similar reduction upon 3 h of co-incubation with amoebae, but roughly 10-fold more bacteria of the <italic>Kp</italic> 700603 strain were observed after 24 h. This could be attributable to the ability of <italic>Kp</italic> 700603 to replicate inside <italic>D. discoideum</italic> cells. In accordance with the viable cell counts, observation of the mixed cultures by confocal microscopy revealed the presence of a high number of <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492 bacteria that were not associated with amoeba cells during all the times monitored (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">3</xref>). Conversely, for all the other strains most bacteria were found associated with <italic>D. discoideum</italic> cells, suggesting that <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492 not only avoid phagocytosis but also the adhesion to phagocytic cells. Taken together, these results show that <italic>D. discoideum</italic> is a suitable model to study different aspects of the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> virulence. In particular, they allowed uncovering striking differences among strains of this species, in the context of their interaction with the host, including traits widely related to pathogenesis such as resistance to phagocytosis, invasion and intracellular survival.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Evaluation of the resistance to phagocytosis of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> using <italic>D. discoideum</italic> as host cell model. <bold>(A)</bold> Extracellular viable bacteria count after different times of <italic>Klebsiella</italic>-amoeba co-incubation.

To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the virulence of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> in the zebrafish larvae, so we sought to develop an infection model suitable to generate pathological effects in the larvae, which could be quantified and compared among different bacterial strains, and also to evaluate the <italic>in vivo</italic> innate immune response of this host. In order to accomplish this, we tried two kinds of inoculation methods: static immersion and injection. Both have been successfully used to cause infections with different bacterial pathogens such as <italic>Edwardsiella tarda</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium (van Soest et al., <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Varas et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2017a</xref>). Regarding the injection method, we followed either a systemic infection or a localized infection approach, based on previous studies of bacterial pathogens using zebrafish embryos (Benard et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Thus, attempting different routes of administration allowed us to set up a successful infection method, as well as to evaluate distinct host responses related to the bacterial entry mechanism, which can help discriminate between bacterial strains with diverse virulence potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Systemic injection of different strains of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> into zebrafish larvae</title><p>To achieve a systemic infection, zebrafish larvae (3-dpf) were injected in the dorsal caudal aorta (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) with 10,000 to 20,000 cells of mCherry-labeled <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492, <italic>Kp</italic> BAA-1705, <italic>Kp</italic> 700603, and <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5&#x003b1; (the latter as a non-pathogenic bacterial control previously validated in this host model; Varas et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2017a</xref>), or with PBS as an injection control.

This is a confined compartment devoid of macrophages and neutrophils, and can be used to study the directed migration of innate immune cells (Benard et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Bacterial cells or PBS (control) were carefully injected in the otic vesicle of Tg(<italic>BACmpo:gfp</italic>) zebrafish larvae harboring GFP-labeled neutrophils, and neutrophil recruitment was quantified by measuring green fluorescence inside the vesicle. Bacterial infection in this compartment normally causes neutrophil recruitment as soon as 3 h after injection (Benard et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). We observed a marked inflammation of the otic vesicle after 8 h of injection, which was similar between all subjects, even those exposed to <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5&#x003b1; (data not shown). To determine whether the fish immune cells are able to clear the bacteria and resolve, we examined the otic vesicle of injected fish 24 h after injection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>; as control, a larva injected with sterile PBS is shown in Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">4B</xref>), when normally the clearance of non-pathogenic bacteria has occurred.

The selected conditions included using Tg(<italic>fli1:egfp</italic>) zebrafish larvae (3 dpf), and co-incubating them with bacteria during a period of 48 h. This transgenic line has a GFP-labeled vasculature, and was chosen to better evaluate the occurrence of bacteremia after immersion, and to obtain a fluorescence signal from the whole larvae (green) to contrast the bacteria-derived fluorescence (red). Afterwards, the larvae were washed to remove unattached bacteria, and then monitored for 4 days after immersion (dpi). Washing was performed daily during the experiment. Unlike to that observed with injections into the circulatory system, no lethality was observed in larvae immersed in suspensions of any <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strain evaluated (data not shown). Since bacterial infections in zebrafish might cause consequences other than death, we monitored the fluorescence of the bacteria within larvae through live-cell imaging. Observation of the larvae under fluorescence revealed that the bacteria accumulated in the gastrointestinal tract. To evaluate and score the colonization, we artificially separated the gut into three major zones: anterior, middle and posterior (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The amount of fluorescence in each zone was observed and an intensity score was assigned: no colonization = 0, low colonization = 1, medium colonization = 2 and high colonization = 3. The sum of the values for each zone was calculated for each individual, representing the total intestinal colonization score (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Photographs of representative individuals of each condition are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>. There were no clear differences between distinct <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains when observing the pattern of colonized zones, although they appear to be prone to colonize the anterior and middle digestive tract rather than the posterior digestive system (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>).

In spite of the strong neutrophil recruitment unleashed, this immune response failed to reduce the bacterial burden in a normal time lapse, compared to non-pathogenic bacteria and to other <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains. As described previously, the capsule is one of the most relevant virulence factors in this species, and indeed it has been previously related to resistance to phagocytosis, immunogenicity, biofilm formation, and tissue colonization. Furthermore, we observed that the macrocolonies formed on sheep-blood and LB agar plates by <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492 but not by <italic>Kp</italic> 700603 or <italic>Kp</italic> BAA-1705 showed a mucoid phenotype, which could also be related to the properties of its capsule. In view of this, we tested if <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492 possess the hypermucoviscous phenotype (highly associated with hypervirulent strains), which has been semi-quantitatively defined by a positive &#x0201c;string test.&#x0201d; This test is positive when a bacteriology inoculation loop is able to generate a viscous string of more than 5 mm in length by stretching bacterial colonies on an agar plate (Shon et al., <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, after streaking and growing <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492 in sheep-blood agar and performing the test, it resulted negative, indicating that this strain is not hypermucoviscous (data not shown).

Since in a previous work we found that genomic islands (GIs) integrated into tRNA-coding genes (tDNAs) are an important source of virulence factors in this species (Marcoleta et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), we started identifying and characterizing the GIs present in the chromosome of the three <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">2</xref>). <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492 chromosome harbors 4 GIs from which GIE492, encoding the determinants for producing microcin E492 and salmochelin siderophore, has a suggested role in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> virulence (Marcoleta et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). No additional putative virulence factors were found in the rest of the GIs, except for a Fe<sup>3+</sup>/spermidine/putrescine transport system encoded in a GI integrated at a Ser tDNA.

General and <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>-specific identification of virulence factors were performed using PathogenFinder (Cosentino et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and Kleborate (Lam et al., in review), respectively. <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492 showed the highest number of predicted virulence factors (294), although many of them correspond to proteins which function has not been addressed experimentally (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">3</xref>). Despite <italic>Kp</italic> BAA-1705 and <italic>Kp</italic> 700603 showed a considerable smaller number of putative virulence factors (130 and 50, respectively) they were predicted as human pathogens by PathogenFinder with a probability of 82.2 and 84.2%, respectively, while KpRYC492 showed a score of 88.7%. Additionally, in the genome of <italic>Kp</italic> 700603 we could not find genes encoding putative homologs to proteins participating in type-III secretion systems (T3SS), such as those encoded in the <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity islands SPI-1 and SPI-2, which have a demonstrated role in invasion and intracellular survival, respectively (Que et al., <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Jennings et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Regarding adhesion factors such as fimbriae, no differences where observed among the three strains. All of them harbor the <italic>mrkA</italic> and <italic>mrkD</italic> genes previously associated with adherence to animal tissues, as well as the <italic>ecpRABCDE</italic> operon, also associated to tissue's adherence (Alc&#x000e1;ntar-Curiel et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Kleborate and Kaptive tools were used to determine the capsular genotype of each strain, which in some cases can be associated to a defined capsular serotype (Wyres et al., <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Lam et al., in review). Kaptive tool classified the capsule <italic>loci</italic> of <italic>Kp</italic> BAA-1705 and <italic>Kp</italic> 700603 as KL107 and KL53, respectively, although none of them have been associated with determined serotypes. Kleborate tool indicated that <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492 possesses genes for the production of two capsular serotypes (K22 and K37). Unfortunately, to our knowledge there are no experimental data regarding the virulence and resistance to phagocytosis of other <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains (besides RYC492) harboring any of these serotypes. Performing similar assays with additional strains of these serotypes will allow us to further test if there is an association between K22/K37 capsule types and an increased resistance to phagocytosis.</p><p>In conclusion and in agreement with the experimental data, genomic analyses allowed the identification of putative pathogenicity islands only in <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492, which also harbored the highest number of predicted virulence factors in different positions of its genome. Nevertheless, it was not possible to associate any of these factors with the phagocytosis resistance phenotype displayed by this strain. Regarding <italic>Kp</italic> 700603, no clear genetic determinants could be associated with its ability to replicate intracellularly in <italic>D. discoideum</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Until now, multidrug-resistant and hypervirulent <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains have evolved separately in distinct clonal groups (Hennequin and Robin, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, given the high genomic plasticity of this species and that the dissemination of both resistance and virulence determinants were associated to similar mobile elements such as plasmids and genomic islands, it is likely that in the near future strains showing both traits will arise. This will certainly represent a challenge to global health, particularly since the interplay between resistance and virulence in this species is poorly understood. Despite its high clinical relevance, the lack of a good animal model for studying pathogenesis has hampered the virulence assessment of multiresistant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains, because in the available mice models they usually behave as avirulent (Diago-Navarro et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Thus, new assays and the use of simple host models will contribute to the understanding of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance. In this context, we presented a series of assays to study <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> virulence using the social amoeba <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and the fish <italic>Danio rerio</italic> as host models. These assays allowed us to observe striking differences in virulence-associated traits among distinct strains of this bacterial pathogen, including resistance to phagocytosis, invasiveness, intracellular survival, intestinal colonization, neutrophil recruitment and lethality. In each host model, these traits were monitored in different physiological contexts observing consistent results, supporting the conservation of the mechanisms involved in the interaction of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> with different hosts.</p><p>The use of non-mammalian host models for studying bacterial pathogenesis has allowed not only to facilitate the evaluation of virulence-associated phenotypes, but also to discover that many of the mechanisms required for infecting diverse hosts are essentially conserved, as well it is the molecular basis of the host's response to the infection. Thus, using different model hosts and exploiting the advantages that each of them offers, allows interesting comparisons regarding the virulence strategies and host defense mechanisms during the infection of phylogenetically distant organisms. In this work, we showed that <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and zebrafish larvae have several advantages to be used as models for study <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> pathogenesis. Their optical transparency and the availability of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> mutant strains and transgenic zebrafish lines permitted to follow the infective process trough live-cell imaging and without requiring invasive sample acquisition. Also, their easy manipulation, rapid growth, and numerous progeny, allowed analyzing a numerous cohort and to perform several replicates, providing more statistical robustness to the conclusions. One of the limitations that have these models is that the infection cannot be performed at 37&#x000b0;C, in circumstances where such temperature is expected to be the optimum for the expression of several virulence factors of human pathogens. In this direction, previous studies demonstrated that more than 120 <italic>E. coli</italic> genes are overexpressed at 37&#x000b0;C, compared with that observed at 23&#x000b0;C, including several involved in the uptake and metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates and iron (White-Ziegler et al., <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). However, there is also evidence indicating that <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium exposed to sublethal heat stress (42&#x000b0;C) responds by altering the expression of several virulence factors, which further enhances the adhesion of bacterial cells to intestinal Caco-2 cells (Sirsat et al., <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Also, Yang et al. (<xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) evaluated the expression of the <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis virulence-related genes <italic>spvR, hilA, sefA</italic>, and <italic>avrA</italic> at different temperatures, showing that most of them are expressed significantly more at 42&#x000b0;C than a 37&#x000b0;C. Moreover, it was shown that <italic>S</italic>. Typhi can grow in seafood incubated at 22&#x000b0;C, and that key virulence-associated genes such as <italic>invA</italic> and <italic>stn</italic> were strongly expressed at this temperature (Kumar et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Furthermore, in previous work we showed that relevant <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium virulence factors required for infection of mammalian host cells and animal models at 37&#x000b0;C, including the type III secretion systems (T3SS) encoded in SPI-1 and SPI-2 pathogenicity islands, are also essential to invade and survive inside <italic>D. discoideum</italic> cells at 23&#x000b0;C (Riquelme et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). All this evidence points out that although mammalian's pathogens are indeed adapted to successfully infect these animal hosts at 37&#x000b0;C, they also can display a wide array of virulence traits at different environmental conditions. This is not surprising considering that part of the existence of many bacterial (human) pathogens occurs outside mammalian's body, where bacteria must interact and/or infect a variety of hosts in a changing environment.</p><p>As mentioned before, other alternative host models have been used to study bacterial pathogenesis, each of them showing advantages and limitations. One of the most used for studying <italic>K. pneuminiae</italic> pathogenesis is the larval state of the wax moth <italic>G. mellonella</italic> (Insua et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Wand et al., <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Mills et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). This model can be maintained at 37&#x000b0;C, and thus allows to study the infective process at the same temperature than that occurring inside mammalian hosts. However, this host is not amenable for live-cell imaging, or for knocking-out host proteins, as <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and zebrafish are. Other cited benefit of using <italic>G. mellonella</italic> model is the multiple options for the delivery of pathogens, such as topical application, oral delivery and injection (Junqueira, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). However, this benefit is also valid for our host models, but with the difference that, in the case of zebrafish, we are using a vertebrate host where not only the innate inmune response but also the adaptive inmunity can be studied.</p><p>Phagocytes are a first line of defense against bacterial pathogens, playing a key role in the host's innate immune response to infection. The amoeba <italic>D. discoideum</italic> shares many traits with human phagocytes including the ability to ingest and kill bacteria, as well as key aspects of membrane trafficking, endocytic transport and sorting events (Bozzaro et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Previous studies have explored the <italic>Klebsiella</italic>-<italic>D. discoideum</italic> interaction, identifying host genes required for the intracellular killing of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (Benghezal et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Remarkably, homologs of those genes also determined <italic>Drosophila</italic>'s susceptibility to this pathogen, supporting the conservation of <italic>Klebsiella</italic>-host interaction mechanisms across distant lineages. Our results are in line with this observation, since RYC492 resulted to be the most virulent <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strain for both the amoeba and zebrafish hosts. Moreover, the resistance to phagocytosis and the capsule properties seem to be key conserved determinants in the infection of different hosts. When we compared <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492 with the previously characterized <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> MGH78578 strain, which was shown to be attenuated in a mice respiratory disease model and highly susceptible to phagocytosis by murine macrophages (Fodah et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), we also observed that <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492 was more virulent. Social development assays performed with <italic>Kp</italic> MGH78578 revealed that it behaved similar to <italic>Kp</italic> BAA1705 and <italic>Kp</italic> 700603, resulting to be mildly virulent to the amoeba (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">6</xref>). This supports the utility of this model to compare the virulence of different <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains. Unfortunately, the extreme resistance of <italic>Kp</italic> MGH78578 to most antibiotics prevented its transformation with a plasmid conferring red fluorescence required for most of the live-cell imaging experiments performed in this study.</p><p>Additional studies support the role of the capsule in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> virulence, where mutants in the biosynthesis of this structure are attenuated in a murine host model (Benghezal et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Furthermore, Pan et al. (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) found several capsular genes related to phagocytosis resistance in a <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> model, and that this trait could be linked to hypervirulence. Later, March et al. (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) explored the role of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> surface structures on its interaction with <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and mouse alveolar macrophages (Broug-Holub et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). As expected, non-capsulated mutants were more susceptible to phagocytosis by both <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and the macrophages. Consistently, such mutants showed attenuated virulence when using a pneumonia mouse model (March et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Similarly, we found that the production of a more prominent capsule correlated with an increased resistance to phagocytosis by <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and to a reduced clearance by immune host cells of zebrafish larvae, as observed for <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492.</p><p>Our assays using <italic>D. discoideum</italic> permitted the evaluation of additional aspects of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> virulence. Through exploiting the amoeba social development, we easily distinguished the highly virulent strain <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492 from the attenuated or mildly virulent strains <italic>Kp</italic> 700603 and <italic>Kp</italic> BAA-1705. Phagocytosis assays using vegetative amoeba cells allowed observing differences in the invasiveness among different strains, and to assess the strong resistance to phagocytosis displayed by <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492. These assays also revealed that <italic>Kp</italic> 700603 could replicate inside <italic>D. discoideum</italic> cells. Both resistance to phagocytosis and intracellular survival traits were confirmed by live-cell imaging of the <italic>Klebsiella</italic>-amoebae interaction. Recently, it was shown that a strain of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> could survive within macrophages in an intracellular compartment that did not fuse with lysosomes, named <italic>Klebsiella</italic> containing vacuole (KCV) (Cano et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The evidence also indicated that <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> has the potential to escape from the phagocyte. Our results support this observation. Detection by confocal microscopy of extracellular bacteria after 24 h post-infection in the gentamicin-protection assays strongly suggest that <italic>Kp</italic> 700603 could escape from <italic>D. discoideum</italic> cells upon replication. It has been shown that <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> capsule is dispensable for intracellular survival and that it would be down regulated inside the KCV (Cano et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Accordingly, we observed no positive correlation between capsule properties and intracellular survival, where the strain showing the most prominent capsule (<italic>Kp</italic> RYC492) was unable to replicate inside amoeba cells. The assays described here could be used as a basis to further investigate the ability of certain <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> isolates to survive inside phagocytic cells. A variety of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> strains harboring fluorescent fusions of proteins localizing to different subcellular compartments are available from Dicty Stock center. Fluorescent labeling of distinct structures of the endocytic pathway would allow to track <italic>in vivo</italic> the fate of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> cells upon host cell invasion, and to identify key events that determine their survival or killing. Furthermore, <italic>D. discoideum</italic> has been used as a model to study autophagy and its role in controlling infection when invasive bacteria escape from endosomal compartments to the cytosol (Calvo-Garrido et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). <italic>D. discoideum</italic> strains mutant in key autophagy proteins can be used to assess the role of this process in the response of the host to <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> intracellular survival. Moreover, the simple manipulation and rapid growth of this amoeba allows to set up simple assays such as those proposed herein to evaluate a large number of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains or mutants, in the search for genes linked to intracellular survival.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first report using zebrafish larvae to study <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> virulence. A recent work used adult zebrafish to test the safety and the efficacy <italic>in vivo</italic> of <italic>Streptomyces</italic>-derived molecules with antibacterial activity against multiresistant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (Cheepurupalli et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). An intramuscular injection protocol was optimized to produce clinical and sub-clinical infections with this pathogen, and to successfully test the efficacy of the antimicrobials <italic>in vivo</italic>. This points out the usefulness of zebrafish model to test <italic>in vivo</italic> molecules directed to counteract <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> infections. Our results showed that this model could also be used to study <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> virulence and the associated host's immune response. Different infection methods (injection/immersion) allowed evaluating traits such as lethality, neutrophil recruitment, bacterial clearance, and intestinal colonization. Remarkably, immersion assays showed that zebrafish larvae could be easily infected with <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> through its natural route of entry, leading to the colonization of different zones of the gastrointestinal tract. Noteworthy, Cheepurupalli et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) observed that immersion in doses of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> up to 10<sup>12</sup> CFU/mL did not lead to clinical symptoms of adult fish, which only were achieved after intramuscular inoculation of 10<sup>12</sup> CFU. In our assays, infection by immersion was achieved using 5&#x02013;8 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mL, while 15,000&#x02013;18,000 CFU were used for injections. This points to an increased susceptibility of the larvae compared to adult zebrafish as a key element to reach <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> infections through immersion. Additionally, using early stages of the zebrafish development allowed us to take advantage of the transparency of the larvae for live-cell imaging studies and to evaluate a high number of individuals for robust statistics analyses. Due to the small size of the larvae, the infections could be performed in 6-well plates, reducing the space requirements and simplifying the manipulation of the animals. On the other hand, Cheepurupalli et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) used <italic>ex vivo</italic> cultures of zebrafish liver to evaluate histopathology and hepatotoxicity of the antimicrobials tested. Unfortunately, such evaluations were not performed after bacterial infection. It would have been interesting to see if <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> can recapitulate a liver abscess in adult zebrafish, and thus using similar <italic>ex vivo</italic> liver cultures to study this kind of infection. Our assays using zebrafish larvae indicated that <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492 showed the highest lethality when injected into the bloodstream, as well as the highest neutrophil recruitment and bacterial burden after 24 h of being injected into the otic vesicle, a compartment normally devoid of neutrophils. This kind of immune cells is crucial for early-stage defense against <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> in mouse infection models (Fukutome et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>; Rehm et al., <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>). A recent study showed that a K1 clinical isolate could resist neutrophil-mediated killing remaining viable up to 24 h after infection, whereas infection of its acapsular mutant was cleared within 12 h (Lee C. H. et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Also, in another report it was demonstrated that there is a good correlation between capsule type (mainly serotypes K1 and K2) and resistance to both extracellular and phagocytic killing by neutrophils isolated from human patients (Lee I. R. et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Our results indicated that the higher neutrophil recruitment and the reduced clearance displayed by <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492 in the zebrafish model, correlated with its strong resistance to phagocytosis by <italic>D. discoideum</italic>, and with the production of a more prominent and irregular capsule.</p><p>Besides the capsule, other factors such as production of siderophores or antibacterial toxins are likely to contribute to <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> virulence. In a previous study, we found that the GIE492 island, coding for the production of microcin E492 and salmochelin, was highly prevalent among liver abscess-associated <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (Marcoleta et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Although not yet experimentally demonstrated, MccE492 production would permit the prevalence of the producers over surrounding cells competing for the same siderophores and thus increasing their iron supply. This effect would be potentiated by the co-production of salmochelin siderophore. Also, it is possible that MccE492 amyloid plays a role in extracellular matrix synthesis and biofilm formation, as observed for the curli fibers produced by <italic>Escherichia</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> (Chapman et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) and the TasA protein from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (Romero et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The direct assessment of these hypotheses has been hampered by the impossibility of making chromosomal deletions in the <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492 strain, although studies using alternative approaches are currently being performed (Marcoleta et al., unpublished results). Regarding salmochelin production, a previous work with hypervirulent <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> showed that aerobactin but not yersiniabactin, salmochelin, or enterobactin, were required for virulence over <italic>in vivo</italic> infection models (Russo et al., <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, additional studies are required to understand the specific role of the wide repertoire of siderophore production systems that compose the pangenome of this species. Further supporting the increased virulence of <italic>Kp</italic> RYC492, we showed that this strain carries a second putative pathogenicity island encoding a phosphotransferase system for the uptake of sugars and a Fe<sup>+3</sup>/spermidine/putrescine transport system, this last related to virulence in several pathogens (Shah and Swiatlo, <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Also, its genome harbors the highest number of predicted virulence factors compared with <italic>Kp</italic> 700603 and <italic>Kp</italic> BAA-1705 (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">3</xref>). Unfortunately, most of these genes code for proteins of unknown function.</p><p>In conclusion, our results showed that the surrogate host models <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and zebrafish larvae offer several advantages for the study of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> virulence. Moreover, these models seem to be very promising tools in the screening for novel anti-virulence molecules against multi-drug resistant pathogens including <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. This was successfully accomplished using <italic>D. discoideum</italic> as a host model to test both the efficacy and the safety of molecules with anti-virulence potential over <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (Bravo-Toncio et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>AM, RL, and MV conceived the work.
