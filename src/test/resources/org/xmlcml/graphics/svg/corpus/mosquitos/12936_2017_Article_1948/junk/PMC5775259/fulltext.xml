In this study we show that the <italic>Drosophila chaski gene</italic> encodes a monocarboxylate transporter protein (MCT/SLC16A) which functions as a lactate/pyruvate transporter, as demonstrated by heterologous expression in mammalian cell culture using a genetically encoded FRET nanosensor. <italic>chaski</italic> expression is prominent in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central nervous system and it is particularly enriched in glia over neurons. <italic>chaski</italic> mutants exhibit defects in a high energy demanding process such as synaptic transmission, as well as in locomotion and survival under nutritional stress. Remarkably, locomotion and survival under nutritional stress defects are restored by <italic>chaski</italic> expression in glia cells. Our findings are consistent with a major role for intercellular lactate shuttling in the brain metabolism of <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The function of the nervous system requires a large supply of energy, as exemplified by the fact that in the mammalian brain, 50&#x02013;60% of total ATP produced in the brain is used to support ion transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>; in flies, retinal photoreceptor cells consume about 10% of the ATP production of the whole animal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Our current view about the field of brain energetics has evolved from a one centered in neurons into a one in which astrocytes and neurons play complementary roles to support the high demand of excitability and synaptic activity. In this view, the metabolic communication between neurons and glia is crucial to sustain brain function, relevating the need to unravel the mechanisms that underly this communication.</p><p id="Par3">Within cells, several glucose-derived metabolic intermediates can subsequently be oxidized for energy production (i.e. lactate, pyruvate, glutamate, or acetate)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, while ketone bodies are mainly used during development and starvation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In mammals, it has been estimated that over 10% of glucose entering the brain is converted to lactate despite normal oxygen levels, a metabolic process known as aerobic glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Lactate production through aerobic glycolysis is a metabolic feature of astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The high-energy demand as the result of glutamatergic synaptic activity is thought to stimulate aerobic glycolysis in astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> producing lactate that is secreted and used by neurons as energy source. This metabolic interaction has been termed the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) hypothesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Recent evidence from invertebrates supports that metabolic compartmentalization and coupling of neurons and glial cells is a conserved, fundamental feature of bilaterian nervous systems independent of their size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Moreover, the lack of an apparent detrimental effect of glycolytic enzyme deletion in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons suggests that insects may have evolved an extreme version of ANLS, in which neurons would be fueled by lactate and/or alanine produced by glial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In vertebrates, lactate is co-transported with protons across the plasma membrane by members of the SLC16A family of monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, following the chemical gradient. The SLC16A family comprises 14 members; while four of them, MCT1 to 4 (encoded by SLC16A 1, 7, 8 and 3 respectively) have been characterized as lactate/pyruvate or ketone acids transporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, others function as transporters for thyroid hormones and aromatic aminoacids; nevertheless, for most of them their substrates have not been identified yet nor their function as transporters has been confirmed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome contains 15 genes with variable homology to members of the mammalian SLC16A family; several of them are expressed in the adult brain and none of them has been fully characterized (flybase.org).</p><p id="Par6">Here, we describe the function of the gene CG3409 predicted to be an MCT, which we named <italic>chaski</italic> (<italic>chk</italic>) in honor to the Inca messenger (chasqui or <italic>chaski</italic>) that carried information to the different villages of the Inca Empire. Our results indicate that <italic>chk</italic> encodes a lactate/pyruvate transporter, which is expressed in larval and adult brain, and enriched in glial cells. We also show that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, global loss of <italic>chk</italic> function associates to defects in synaptic transmission and locomotion, as well to impaired survival during starvation. Most significantly, the reintroduction of <italic>chk</italic> only in glia cells restores the resistance to starvation and the locomotion activity. In summary, we describe here for the first time the function of an MCT expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, highlighting the remarkable conservation of metabolic mechanisms in the brain and further supporting a role for lactate shuttling in the nervous system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title><italic>chaski</italic> has the signature of a monocarboxylate transporter</title><p id="Par7"><italic>chk</italic> (Flybase ID FBgn0033095, annotated as CG3409) was identified by homology to mammalian MCTs and selected among genes expressed in the adult fly brain (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0033095.html">http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0033095.html</ext-link>).

Based on Chk sequence divergence with mammalian MCTs we predicted that it would be insensitive to the AR-C155858 inhibitor (for a more detailed explanation see supplemental material). Most of the cells of <italic>chk</italic>-transfected HEK293 cultures exposed to extracellular lactate responded with an acute increase in intracellular lactate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D,E</xref>). More important, in the presence of the MCT1/2 inhibitor, there was absence of a slow increase of FRET signal, which is consistent with the view that Chk is insensitive to this reagent and precludes the accumulation of endogenously generated lactate. Notably, the cells with the strongest response in the presence of the blocker also displayed a higher lactate uptake in the absence of the blocker (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>), condition in which the artificially expressed protein adds to the endogenous transport function.

In summary, the most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that Chk functions as a lactate transporter and that is insensitive to the MCT1/2 blocker AR-C155858.</p><p id="Par11">To further characterize Chk, HEK293 cells were incubated with glucose to increase intracellular lactate and then the cells were exposed to the monocarboxylate transporter substrates pyruvate (metabolizable) or oxamate (non-metabolizable) to evaluate Chk ability to undergo transacceleration. Transacceleration (or accelerated exchange) is a characteristic of monocarboxylate transporters by which the transport in the manner of a symporter type carrier can be activated by the occupancy in trans, which in this experiment is observed as extrusion of lactate by the import of pyruvate or oxamate (occupancy in trans). As observed in the control trace of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>, the addition of pyruvate or oxamate resulted in a rapid and transient decrease of intracellular lactate, as expected of transcacceleration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In the presence of AR-C155858 an increase in the cytosolic lactate is observed due to the blockage of lactate extrusion (as in the presence of glucose there is a constant production of lactate that is also constantly extruded through MCTs transporters). While MCT1/2 blockage associated to an effective impairment of transacceleration in control cells, the exposure to AR-C155858 in <italic>chk</italic>-transfected cells only marginally affects it (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2F,G</xref>) further supporting that Chk is a true transporter (as opposed to a channel) able to carry lactate/pyruvate/oxamate transport, sharing its mechanism of transport with mammalian MCTs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title><italic>chk</italic> is expressed in both neuronal and glia cells</title><p id="Par12">Although Chk is known to be expressed in the central nervous system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0033095.html">http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0033095.html</ext-link>), it is also expressed abundantly in fat body and Malphigian tubule in the adult (flybase.org).

However, the highest homology is observed with Human SLC16A14 (using software: Compara, Isobase and Round-up), which has an unknown function or substrate.

Chk, however, shows much lower homology to SLCA2 (MCT8) or SLC10A (TAT), the thyroid hormone transporter and the aromatic amino acid transporter; supporting our results that its substrates are monocarboxylic acids. Our results using heterologous expression of Chk in HEK cells show that it functions as a monocarboxylate transporter that has the capability of translocate lactate, pyruvate and oxamate according to their concentration gradient and the ability to transaccelerate in the presence of substrate in both sides. The molecular mechanism by which this is accomplished was not investigated; it is worth noting that none of the key aminoacids identified for mammalian MCTs1 to 4 for the recognition of the substrate or the H+&#x02009;linked transport are conserved in the Chk protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> Surprisingly, the phenylalanine identified as the selectivity filter is conserved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

Two recent reports suggest a major role of MCT transporters in the transfer of metabolites between neuronal and glial cells and a tight coupling between this process and behavior.

Considering the evidence that glia cells display higher glycolytic activity than neurons and release lactate and alanine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, these reports support the key role of metabolite shuttling between glia and neurons where MCT transporters play a major role.</p><p id="Par25">Besides the analysis of expression patterns and functional identification of the Chk protein as a transporter we sought to advance our understanding of the overall role of lactate transport at the organism level, taking advantage of an already available <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant and a our own construction, which by different molecular mechanism attain a similar loss of <italic>chk</italic> function.

Considering the function of Chk protein as lactate/pyruvate transporter demonstrated here, it is possible to speculate that the synaptic defects are mechanistically related to the metabolic unbalance. This could affect the ability to maintain ionic gradients, one of the most energy demanding processes in the synapse. Plausible explanations for this phenotype include a defect in the extrusion of presynaptic calcium that could lead to higher calcium levels and increased release in response to activation or an increased excitability that results in more calcium entry and the consequent increased release. This is supported by the fact that the defect was evident only at higher extracellular calcium concentration. More studies will be necessary to address the mechanisms that lead to this synaptic phenotype.</p><p id="Par28">The climbing assay provides a more general assessment of the function of the nervous system in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

Nevertheless, and in a strikingly coincident manner with the results discussed above, the reintroduction of Chk protein expression only in glial cells suffices to restore the physiological phenotype, pointing again to a crucial role of glial lactate transport in supporting brain function.</p><p id="Par29">The adult mammalian brain is almost exclusively energized by glucose.
