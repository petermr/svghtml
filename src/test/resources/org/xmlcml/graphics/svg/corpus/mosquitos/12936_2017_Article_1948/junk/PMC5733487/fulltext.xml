Sox2/3<sup>+</sup> cells present in the spinal cord of regenerative larvae are required for spinal cord regeneration. Here we evaluate the effect of the transplantation of spinal cord cells from regenerative larvae into the resected spinal cord of non-regenerative stages (NR-stage). Donor cells were able to survive up to 60 days after transplantation in the injury zone. During the first 3-weeks, transplanted cells organize in neural tube-like structures formed by Sox2/3<sup>+</sup> cells. This was not observed when donor cells come from non-regenerative froglets. Mature neurons expressing NeuN and Neurofilament-H were detected in the grafted tissue 4 weeks after transplantation concomitantly with the appearance of axons derived from the donor cells growing into the host spinal cord, suggesting that Sox2/3<sup>+</sup> cells behave as neural stem progenitor cells. We also found that cells from regenerative animals provide a permissive environment that promotes growth and regeneration of axons coming from the host. These results suggest that Sox2/3 cells present in the spinal cord of regenerative stage (R-stage) larvae are most probably neural stem progenitor cells that are able to survive, proliferate, self-organize and differentiate into neurons in the environment of the non-regenerative host. In addition, we have established an experimental paradigm to study the biology of neural stem progenitor cells in spinal cord regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic></kwd><kwd>spinal cord injuries</kwd><kwd>transplantation</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>neural stem cells</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Comisi&#x000f3;n Nacional de Investigaci&#x000f3;n Cient&#x000e0;&#x000ad;fica y Tecnol&#x000f3;gica<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002848</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">21120400</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="56"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="8685"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Worldwide an estimate of 3 million people live with Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) and approximately 180,000 new cases happen every year with severe implications for their quality of life (Lee et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Paraplegia and quadriplegia are a consequence of the inefficient regenerative ability of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Different mechanisms involved in this lack of regeneration have been described, on one hand the presence of a non-permissive environment formed by a glial scar containing reactive glia, fibroblasts and meningeal cells, myelin-associated proteins and extracellular matrix components that all together inhibit axonal growth (Burda and Sofroniew, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and also the lack of intrinsic regenerative programs in most adult neurons (He and Jin, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In addition, although neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPC) are present in encephalic niches and physiological neurogenesis has been described (Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), there is no formation of new neurons in the spinal cord in response to injury (Meletis et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Sabelstr&#x000f6;m et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In those cases were NSPC have been detected in the spinal cord, cells that enter proliferation after injury are only fated to differentiate into astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Horner et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Meletis et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The proliferation of ependymal cells has been observed in association with spinal cord growth (Alfaro-Cervello et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Recently it has been reported that ependymal cells proliferate after injury and form astrocytes and oligodendrocytes that contribute to a glial scar that limits the secondary damage (Meletis et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Sabelstr&#x000f6;m et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), although this evidence seems controversial (Ren et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>Non-mammalian vertebrates, including lampreys, teleost fishes, amphibians and lizards (Becker and Becker, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Diaz Quiroz and Echeverri, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Lee-Liu et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) are able to regenerate their CNS. These species achieve spinal cord recovery through axon regeneration, reconstitution of the ependymal channel and neurogenesis implicating the formation of new neurons from NSPC present on the spinal cord (Tanaka and Ferretti, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Among amphibians urodeles (salamanders, newts) maintain their regenerative capacity throughout their lives, but anurans such as <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> frogs are able to efficiently regenerate after full spinal cord transection at stages before metamorphosis (Regenerative stages, R-stages) and this ability is lost during metamorphosis and juvenile froglets (non-regenerative stages, NR-stages) are no longer able to recover from SCI (Forehand and Farel, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>; Beattie et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; Diaz Quiroz and Echeverri, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Lee-Liu et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>In frogs, motor and sensory information from the spinal cord is mainly integrated at the level of the brainstem (mesencephalon and rhombencephalon), instead of the prosencephalon as in mammals, implicating the absence of corticospinal tracts. Most descending supraspinal neurons are already born at stage 53 (R-stage) and their axonal tracts extend into the spinal cord at different stages during metamorphosis (van Mier and ten Donkelaar, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>; S&#x000e1;nchez-Camacho et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Anterograde and retrograde labeling experiments carried out in <italic>X. laevis</italic> demonstrated that in R-stage animals supraspinal axons can grow and regenerate through the injury site, but ascending sensorial nerves are unable to regenerate (Beattie et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; Gibbs and Szaro, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Gibbs et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Lee-Liu et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). On the contrary and in correlation with the absence of functional recovery, reconstitution of the descending supraspinal projections was not detected in NR-stages (Beattie et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>). This failure to regenerate could be explained because of the absence of an intrinsic mechanism for axon regeneration and the presence of a non-permissive environment.</p><p>Sox2 is a transcription factor necessary for maintaining self-renewal and pluripotency in most stem cells including NSPC and is also required for cell reprogramming (Avilion et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Graham et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Ferri et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Sarkar and Hochedlinger, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The spinal cords of <italic>X. laevis</italic> regenerative larvae, zebrafish and axolotl are abundant in NSPC expressing Sox2 and these cells are activated in response to SCI and are necessary for tail and spinal cord regeneration (Gaete et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Fei et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Hui et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Mu&#x000f1;oz et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). After injury Sox2/3<sup>+</sup> cells proliferate, self-organize in neural tube-like structures, and differentiate into neurons (Mu&#x000f1;oz et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Electron microscopy analysis from injured R-stage animals showed axons growing in close association with ependymal processes in the ablation gap, suggesting the ependymal cells (Sox2/3<sup>+</sup> cells) provide molecular cues for axon regeneration (Michel and Reier, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>). Contrary to that, Sox2/3<sup>+</sup> cells are less abundant in the spinal cord of NR-stages of <italic>X. laevis</italic> (Mu&#x000f1;oz et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and in adult rodents, interestingly they are poorly activated in response to injury correlating with the absence of efficient regeneration (Hamilton et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>Currently, no effective therapy for SCI is available. Cell transplantation strategies have been proposed and tested as a potential therapy to improve neural regeneration. Early phase clinical trials have been performed showing that cell transplantation using different cell types from embryonic and adult tissues (e.g., embryonic stem cells, Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes precursors, olfactory ensheathing cells, NSPC and mesenchyme stem cells) is achievable (Tetzlaff et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Li and Lepski, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Despite the intense research in cell transplantation little is known about the mechanisms involved in the ability of transplanted cells to improve repair and functional recovery and more knowledge is necessary to attain significant functional improvement, long-term effects, and optimal safety levels. Possible mechanisms involved in how NSPC can improve regeneration include: promote axon regeneration/sprouting, neuroprotection, modulation of glial scar formation, immunomodulation, neurogenesis and myelin regeneration (Assinck et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>The Tuszynski laboratory has carried one of the most successful experiments of cell transplantation in rodents. Spinal cords from rodent embryos containing NSPC were dissociated and embedded in fibrin matrices together with a cocktail of growth factors (GF) and then transplanted into fully transected spinal cords resulting in the formation of neurons that extended large numbers of axons at long distances with the formation of electrophysiological relays and mature synapses with host axons that allowed significant functional recovery (Lu et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Moreover, the same strategy promotes regeneration in the largely refractory corticospinal tract especially when the transplanted cells come from the caudal region of the spinal cord (Kadoya et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). These results support the idea that transplanted NSPC can make new neurons in the injury site and also enhance intrinsic properties of host neurons to overcome the non-permissive environment present in the injured spinal cord (Lu et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Although very successful more work needs to be done to allow translational impact, especially because it was reported that the transplanted NSPC can migrate to other areas of the CNS and form ectopic colonies with potential detrimental effects (Steward et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Assinck et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>In order to understand the mechanism and effects of cell transplantation on improving spinal cord recovery here we have established experimental conditions to allow successful transplantation of dissociated spinal cords isolated from <italic>X. laevis</italic> R-stages into NR-stage froglets in which the spinal cord was previously resected. Using this experimental approach here we showed that transplanted cells from R-stage spinal cords, mainly Sox2/3<sup>+</sup> cells, can survive and proliferate in the host environment and self-organize in neural tube-like structures. After 30 days transplanted cells differentiate into mature neurons that express Neurofilaments and NeuN and also extend long axons into the host&#x02019;s spinal cord. In addition, the transplanted cells improved growth and regeneration of host axons that are normally refractory and unable to grow. In summary, we have established an experimental paradigm to study the mechanisms that allow NSPC from regenerative pre-metamorphic frogs to improve spinal cord regeneration in non-regenerative froglets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Husbandry and Surgery of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic></title><p>Wild Type frogs were obtained from Nasco (Fort Atkinson, WI, USA).

For all surgical procedures, animals were anesthetized by incubation in 0.02% MS222, also known as Tricaine (Ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate, Sigma-Aldrich, A5040). 2 min for tadpoles and 10 min for froglets. Spinal cord resection and postoperative manipulation were executed as previously described (Edwards-Faret et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Briefly, anesthetized froglets were moved to a gauze on top of a 10 cm petri dish, the dorsal skin was opened with a longitudinal incision above the spinal cord using microscissors, followed by careful lift of the dorsal muscles to expose the vertebrae. A dorsal laminectomy was performed between the 5th and 6th vertebrae using forceps followed by a complete resection of 1 mm of the spinal cord.

Spinal cords were dissected from anesthetized animals and dissociated enzymatically by incubation in StemPro Accutase (Gibco, A1110501) and vortexing at room temperature for 1 h (NF stage 50) or 2 h (NF stage 66). Then, the single cell suspension was incubated with Trypan Blue (Sigma-Aldrich, T8154) and living cells counted using a hemocytometer. Cells were centrifuged at 200 RCF for 5 min, resuspended in L-15 Medium (Sigma-Aldrich, L4386) and supplemented with 0.5 mg/mL BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, A7906), 10 ng/mL FGF2 (R&#x00026;D System 3139-FB-025/CF), 10 ng/mL EGF (R&#x00026;D System 2028-EG-200), and 10 ng/mL BDNF (R&#x00026;D System 248-BD-025/CF). This cocktail has the purpose of improving survival of transplanted cells. Then, the cell suspension was mixed with a 1:1 volume of 100 mg/mL of Fibrinogen (Sigma-Aldrich, F6755) and 100 U/mL Thrombin (Sigma-Aldrich, T5772), these proteins will form a clot and retain the cells avoiding its dispersion when transplanted. A suspension containing 100,000 cells were transplanted into the spinal cord of NF stage 66 animals resected as described above. Control animals received the same cocktail of GF together with fibrinogen and thrombin but without cells. For axon labeling at 1 week before the end of the experiment, reticulospinal and vestibulospinal tracts were anterogradely labeled by injection of 60 nl of 15% biotinylated dextran amine (BDA; MW 10,000, Thermo-Fisher, D1956) into the right and left medial-lateral hindbrain (Nieuwenhuys et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Immunofluorescence and Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Tissue processing and immunofluorescence were performed as described (Mu&#x000f1;oz et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) with minor modifications. Briefly, animals were anesthetized in 0.2% MS222 per 10 min, they were fixed by transcardial perfusion with 4% PFA in 0.8&#x000d7; calcium and magnesium-free Dulbecco&#x02019;s PBS (CMF-PBS). The spinal cord containing vertebrae was dissected and then decalcified incubating the cords in 0.5 M EDTA in CMF-PBS (pH 7.8, 4&#x000b0;C) during 24 h at 4&#x000b0;C in a nutating mixer (Harms et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Tissues were cryoprotected with increasing concentration of sucrose (from 10% to 30%) and OCT (Tissue-Tek 25608-930). Cryosections of 10 &#x003bc;m were obtained and were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in CMF-PBS (PBST) at room temperature for 10 min, blocked with 10% inactivated goat serum diluted in PBST for 30 min, incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature and stained with Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific H1399). Antibodies used were mouse mAb anti-Sox2 (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology, L1D6A2), rabbit pAb anti-GFP (1:200, Abcam, ab6556), rabbit pAb anti-Neurofilament-200 (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich, N4142), NeuN (1:1000 SDIX, Custom made, see below) and Alexa Fluor 488 or 555 (1:500; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), donkey pAb anti-Rabbit conjugated HRP (1:500, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA, SA1-200) as secondary antibodies. Regarding the specificity of the primary antibodies, it is important to mention that the peptide used for the preparation of the anti-Sox2 antibody is conserved in Sox3; therefore, is not possible to rule out that this antibody also recognizes Sox3 (Mu&#x000f1;oz et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The antibody against Neurofilament-200 has been previously used in <italic>X. laevis</italic> (Lin et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). We used Streptavidin Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate for BDA detection (1:200, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA, S11223). For immunohistochemistry, we used a pretreatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 1% in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Then blocked and incubated with antibodies as mentioned before, the detection was made with DAB Peroxidase (HRP) Substrate Kit (with Nickel), 3,3&#x02032;-diaminobenzidine for 10 min at room temperature (Vector Laboratory, SK4100).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Preparation of Antibodies Against NeuN</title><p>A specific peptide for <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> NeuN was designed using the fox3-derived sequence (BC088942.1) as a template (Kim et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).

For heterochronic experiments, corresponding to transplantation experiments using donor and host animals from different stages, we used as donors animals at NF stage 50 (R-stage) from the transgenic line Xla.Tg(CAG:Venus)<sup>Ueno</sup> that ubiquitously express the Venus reporter gene under the control of the CAG promoter (cytomegalovirus enhancer fused to the chicken beta-actin promoter) and wild type juvenile froglets at NF stage 66 (NR-stage) as host (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Spinal cords from donor animals were isolated, enzymatically dissociated and the cells supplemented with a cocktail of GF including FGF2, EGF and BDNF and mixed with a matrix of Fibrinogen and Thrombin and then transplanted into the injury site of host animals immediately after spinal cord resection. At 20 days post transplantation (dpt) GFP<sup>+</sup> cells from the donor were engrafted in the injury site of host froglets and 93% of the cells in the graft come from the donor&#x02019;s spinal cord and no GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were found outside the transplantation site (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,C</xref>).

For this similar heterochronic transplantation experiments were performed but in this case, we also included a control experiment were the host froglets only received the matrix and the GF cocktail without cells. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that at 10 dpt host animals that received donor cells already showed the formation of rosette structures and cells engrafted in the transplantation site, but only the matrix was observed in the control experiments (see Supplementary Figures S2A&#x02013;D). At 40 dpt, we observed, even more, cells engrafted in the injury site of animals that received donor cells, but no cells were observed in the control experiments and also at this day the matrix was already degraded and reabsorbed (see Supplementary Figures S3A&#x02013;D).</p><p>To test if cell survival, engraftment and rosette formation were specific for cells from the spinal cords obtained from R-stage larvae, we performed homochronic experiments, corresponding to transplantation experiments using donors and host animals from the same stages. For this, we used NR-stage froglets from the transgenic line Xla.Tg(CAG:Venus)<sup>Ueno</sup> as donors and wild type animals at the same stage as hosts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Spinal cords from the donor animals were isolated, cells dissociated and transplanted into NR-stage froglets using the same conditions described above. Despite the fact that the same amount of living cells were transplanted, at 20 dpt only a few GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were found in the injury site forming very small rosette structures (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B,C</xref>; arrowheads). We also observed rosettes formed by GFP negative cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B,C</xref>; arrows). These results demonstrate that the spinal cords from R-stage larvae contain cells that are able to survive and form rosette structures in a non-regenerative host and that cells with the ability to survive after transplantation were no longer present or present at very low levels in the spinal cord of non-regenerative animals.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Transplantation of spinal cord cells from non-regenerative froglets. <bold>(A)</bold> Diagram of a homochronic transplantation experiment using the transgenic line Xla.Tg(CAG:Venus)<sup>Ueno</sup> as donor. <bold>(B,C)</bold> Sagittal sections of spinal cords from NF stage 66 animals at 20 dpt stained with <bold>(B)</bold> &#x003b1;-GFP antibodies (green) and <bold>(C)</bold> Hoechst (blue).

Because of this, we decided to evaluate the possibility that Sox2/3<sup>+</sup> cells are involved in the formation of rosette structures after heterochronic transplantation. First, we check if the transgenic line used for transplantation experiments express GFP in the spinal cord, and we found that most Sox2/3<sup>+</sup> cells in the ependymal layer of R-stage larvae expressed GFP (see Supplementary Figure S4). Then we performed immunofluorescence against Sox2/3 in animals after heterochronic transplantation and found that most of the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells present in the rosette structures expressed Sox2/3 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,D,E</xref>). Quantification of these structures showed that at 20 dpt rosette structures containing Sox2/3<sup>+</sup> cells occupied approximately 17% of the graft and only 6% at 60 dpt (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,D,H</xref>). Of note, each rosette observed have different level of Sox2/3 expression along its long axis (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B,C,E,F</xref>) that is very similar to the dorsal to ventral gradient expression found in the spinal cord of R-stage animals (Edwards-Faret et al., under revision).

At later days we observed an increase in the appearance of mature neurons (NeuN<sup>+</sup>; NF-H) and axons derived from the transplanted cells are able to grow into the host spinal cord. These results suggest that Sox2/3 cells present in the spinal cord of R-stage larvae are most probably NSPC that are able to survive, proliferate, self-organize and differentiate into neurons in the environment of the non-regenerative host.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Spinal Cord Cells from Regenerative Animals Provides a Permissive Substrate for the Growth and Regeneration of Axons from Non-regenerative Animals</title><p>The absence of intrinsic programs and a non-permissive environment are the main reasons to explain why axon regeneration fails in mammals and other non-regenerative organisms.

Anurans do not have corticospinal tracts or tracts that descent directly from telencephalon into the spinal cord (Nieuwenhuys et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). But it is known that brainstem nuclei regenerate in R-stage animals (Beattie et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>) and for that reason, we labeled descending tracts in NF stage 66 animals injecting BDA in one side of the hindbrain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>).

However, transplantation experiments in larvae and froglets are less common. One of the few experiments reported is the transplant of limb bud cells between regenerative and NR-stage (Lin et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Here we adapted a protocol used in rats in order to study the properties of cells present in the spinal cord of R-stages of <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic>. We found that some cells were able to survive and engraft under the injury conditions present in NR-stages even when transplanted immediately after the injury was performed. Something that is not observed in mammals was cells usually die when they are transplanted immediately after injury (Tetzlaff et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Although, we have not checked how many cells die during the first days after transplantation, the fact that a few scattered cells are observed at 1 dpt but then at 10, 20 and 30 dpt (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> with Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C,E,G</xref>) many more cells are engrafted indicates that the transplanted cells that survive are able to proliferate and fill the injury site. This observation of growth after a phase of cell death is in line with recent reports in transplantation experiments performed in rodents (Lu et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>We have found that graft is formed by cells from the donor and no cells derived from the host are found in the graft. Donor cells in the graft can self-organize in neural tube-like structures formed by Sox2/3<sup>+</sup> cells that are very reminiscent of structures formed in the injury site after spinal cord transection of R-stage animals. This type of rosette structures have been observed in the formation of different organs during development, including the formation of the neural tube and in the subventricular zone (Harding et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In addition, the formation of rosette structures is a hallmark of <italic>in vitro</italic> neural differentiation of human Embryonic Stem Cell (hESC) and are dependent on the presence of FGF2 (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Interestingly, FGF is necessary for the formation of &#x0201c;glial-bridges&#x0201d; and subsequent axon regeneration in the spinal cord of Zebrafish (Goldshmit et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), These pieces of evidence suggest that we could be inducing rosette formation with the addition of FGF2, but could also be produced by a self-organization mechanism of the Sox2/3<sup>+</sup> cells from the R-stage larvae.</p><p>The process of differentiation of the transplanted cells follows what occurs during normal development of the nervous system. During the first weeks, the transplanted cells proliferate with the concomitant increase in the size of the graft, cells organize in neural tube-like structures and express Sox2/3<sup>+</sup> but no markers of neural differentiation were detected. Three to four weeks after transplantation a decrease in the Sox2/3<sup>+</sup> neural tube-like structures was detected accompanied by the expression of markers such as NeuN and NF-H and the ability of axons from the graft to grow into the host spinal cord. All these results indicate that transplanted cells can proliferate and differentiate into mature neurons suggesting that the R-stage spinal cord contains NSPC. The temporality of differentiation is quite remarkable because coincidently it takes 1 month for a tadpole to metamorphose into a froglet, this agrees with the recent evidence that human NSC transplanted into rats spinal cord retain an intrinsic temporality for differentiation (Lu et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the ability of axons from the graft to grow into the host spinal cord, we found axons growing into the rostral and caudal spinal cord, but also into peripheral motor nerves, suggesting that some motor neurons are present in our transplanted tissue. However, we have not use any marker for motoneurons such as Islet-1 or the homeobox gene Hb9. These results are different compared with experiments performed in rats (Lu et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), where axons growing away from transplanted cells were detected already at 1 day after transplantation. However, both protocols are not identical, among other differences we can mention that: (i) here we only have used three growth factors (FGF, EGF, BDNF) and they have used a cocktail of 14 GF; (ii) we used a concentration of GF that is 1000 less than the one used in rats; and (iii) we have performed cell transplantation immediately after injury and cells were transplanted into rats spinal cord 2-weeks after injury emulating a chronic clinical condition.</p><p>Transplanted cells promote axons from non-regenerative froglets to grow and regenerate. Previous work showed that axons after NF stage 60 are refractory to regenerate after injury (Beattie et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; Gibbs et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Our results agree with the recent evidence reported in rats, indicating that severed axons sense a pro-regenerative signal in transplanted cells particularly when they are homotypic (Kadoya et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This evidence argues against the idea of lack of a regenerative program and proposes the idea of a pro-regenerative program that can be turned on by a permissive environment that in this case is the presence of transplanted cells from regenerative animals. With the experiments reported here, we are not able to identify the specific population of neurons that are regenerating and the cells from the donor that promote axon growth and regeneration. In other regenerative species, meningeal and glial cells seem to promote axon regeneration (Zukor et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Goldshmit et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Here we have established an experimental paradigm to study the mechanisms that allow NSPC from regenerative frogs to improve spinal cord regeneration in non-regenerative animals. Although we have found positive effects of transplanted cells at the anatomical and histological level in the conditions tested no significant functional recovery has been detected (data not shown). Many aspects to improve the efficiency of these transplantation experiments remain open for further exploration. Although we did not include any immune suppression in our transplantation experiments, immune rejection could probably explain the possible cell death during the first days after transplantation. In limb transplantation experiments it has been demonstrated the importance of suppressing the froglet immune system to improve survival of cells coming from NF stage 53 donors (Lin et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) supporting the possibility that better results could be obtained if immune suppression is included. In addition, it is known that better results could be attained when cells are transplanted 1&#x02013;2 weeks after transplantation and when other GF are added (Tetzlaff et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Lu et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In the future, testing new conditions to improve the effects of cell transplantation in anatomical and histological recovery can be correlated with functional improvements using kinematic analysis in non-regenerative froglets (Beyeler et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>Transplantation of NSPC has been proposed as a potential therapy to improve recovery after SCI. However, there is limited knowledge and understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanism through which these cells improve CNS function and which are the best conditions to attain significant efficiency. The most common mechanisms include neuroprotection, immunomodulation, axon regeneration, neuronal relay formation and myelin regeneration (Assinck et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). We envision that cellular transplantation studies between regenerative and non-regenerative <italic>Xenopus</italic> stages could aid in understanding the mechanisms that allow NSPC to promote recovery after damage to the spinal cord and also to identify the conditions to improve the efficacy of these therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>EEM-O performed all the experiments.
