This makes it very difficult for decision makers to keep abreast of the latest evidence. The Campbell and Cochrane Equity Group is committed to finding ways of helping decision makers access and use the evidence on interventions that has impact on health inequities. Health inequities are avoidable differences in health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The importance of equity in health, wellbeing and wealth is increasingly accepted globally, and it underpins research, global development goals and reports, and international declarations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The Campbell and Cochrane Collaborations, and other groups, such as the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research and the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie), publish systematic reviews of the evidence for what works and what does not. There has been an increased emphasis on health equity in systematic reviews with the establishment of a Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group (Equity Methods Group), whose members have provided a framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] for applying an &#x02018;equity lens&#x02019; to systematic reviews.</p><p id="Par15">However, there is an ongoing need for dissemination and integrated knowledge translation of systematic reviews, to make users aware of knowledge and facilitate its use to improve health and health systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

E4E applies an equity lens to systematic reviews through a knowledge translation product comprising summaries of systematic reviews from the Cochrane and Campbell libraries. E4E translates evidence from systematic reviews into &#x0201c;friendly front-end&#x0201d; summaries for policy makers. Building on these other collections of summaries, E4E aims to summarize evidence on interventions that may reduce inequities. The aim of this special collection of systematic review summaries is to provide policy makers, clinicians, and other practitioners, particularly those working in resource-limited settings, with easily accessible, high quality evidence on relevant interventions.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par22">Despite the increased recognition of the importance of knowledge translation of systematic reviews which summarize the totality of the evidence, there is very little done to prioritize topics for focused knowledge translation efforts.

The topic areas listed above are still relevant to the SDGs. Goal number 3 addresses all health priorities and includes reproductive, maternal and child health; communicable and non-communicable diseases; as well as access for all to safe, effective, and affordable medicines and vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition, goal number 10 is to reduce inequalities within and between countries and focuses on eliminating inequities based on age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, and socioeconomic or other status.</p><p id="Par30">Systematic reviews on these five topic areas were retrieved through a search in the Cochrane Library (via Wiley (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cochranelibrary.com">http://www.cochranelibrary.com</ext-link>/), up to 2013, Issue 6) using relevant key words in the title field and limiting the start date to 2008.

For each panel, a chair(s) was recruited based on their expertise in one or both conditions and in conducting systematic reviews. The chair(s) helped identify and approach five other policy makers and researchers (stakeholders) to join the panel.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par47">With the realisation that single studies, however large, should not drive policy due to the fact that they may not be replicable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] there has been an exponential increase in systematic reviews. Research community members, especially those working on reducing health inequities, have a responsibility to inform policymakers and their advisors who make decisions on which systematic reviews should be prioritized for knowledge translation for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of their populations. Such global exercises need to be sensitive to major regional differences in needs and perceived priorities.</p><p id="Par48">Our approach differs from other priority-setting exercises because we chose to focus on prioritizing knowledge translation of completed systematic reviews that have the potential to promote health equity. We also involved those who need and use this evidence with researchers and publishers in order to meet the information needs for those making decisions related to equity. The intent is to provide an international platform to deliver summaries from systematic reviews on interventions that impact on health in disadvantaged populations. The target audience includes policymakers, clinicians, regulators, and the general public. This E4E initiative addresses the criticism that Cochrane reviews fail to draw useful conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and instead call for more research by prioritizing reviews with potential for health equity impact for knowledge translation and broad dissemination.</p><p id="Par49">Consensus was successfully achieved in identifying the top group of equity-relevant interventions in each of the five pilot areas. The intent was not to focus on specific ranking; rather, it was to provide a matrix across these five criteria to highlight the importance of health equity in decisions on identifying priority interventions given limited resources. The next step is to meet with the relevant Campbell and Cochrane review groups, and other interested systematic review groups, and explore with them whether and how this process can be incorporated into their own priority-setting processes for knowledge translation, as the Cochrane and Campbell Collaborations are both currently developing knowledge translation strategies for their reviews.</p><p id="Par50">Many Cochrane systematic reviews are focused on intervention efficacy, and equity concerns are often more related to intervention implementation and delivery. Therefore, the evidence in the review may not relate to its actual importance in practice. To address this issue, we asked our stakeholders to consider the feasibility of the intervention, deliverability, universality, and effects on health equity. We did not include non-experimental data on harms in this exercise but will include this information in future updates, when available.</p><p id="Par51">Our methods for this priority-setting exercise are similar to those used by other groups, such as Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative CHNRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and the James Lind Alliance, which uses priority-setting partnerships to develop priorities for ten intervention uncertainties for consideration by research funders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Our approach also aligns with guidance provided by Lavis et al. for health decision makers (policy and programs) which includes using explicit criteria based on the underlying problem and burden of disease and intervention options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Other papers similarly describe priority-setting exercises for research. These methods include surveys and face-to-face consultations and evidence mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">Informing decision makers should involve providing an easily understood &#x02018;Friendly Front-End&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Firstly, this derivative summary must provide information on not only the relative effect or statistical significance alone, but also the absolute magnitude of the benefits as well as potential harms, where relevant. Secondly, for those interventions with meaningful, substantive benefit, policymakers also require guidance on: a) ease of implementation of the intervention, including the available capacity and human resources; b) health system requirements and effects on the health system c) universality &#x02013; i.e., the magnitude of the burden of illness in the country of interest. Finally, policymakers should be informed about whether the intervention will reduce health inequities. There is very little research available on the types of policy summaries and their impact on policy-makers knowledge and decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Strengths</title><p id="Par53">Each topic area was co-led by an internationally-recognized &#x0201c;content leader&#x0201d; in the respective content field (i.e., depression, diabetes/obesity, HIV, malaria, and nutrition). Each content leader was teamed up with a Cochrane methodologist with expertise in performing systematic reviews in the same area. Each team was composed of a mixture of researchers and policymakers. The explicit focus on equity was helped by the delineation of the three additional criteria: a) the ease of implementation of the intervention, including the available capacity; b) Health system requirements and effects on the health system c) Universality, or the magnitude of the burden of illness in the country of interest. Consensus was achieved remarkably easily on the assessment criteria. Also, disaggregation of the components contributing to the total score did not show any one of the components driving the total score. This may well be different for a specific country or program where there are political factors and competing programs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Challenges/weaknesses</title><p id="Par54">It was challenging building the teams as both leaders and team members are in great demand; they are all very busy and typically do not attend Cochrane or other systematic review meetings. There was no financial payment nor academic reward beyond this publication. We initially planned to hold teleconferences but the logistics proved daunting so although we did meet in person or electronically with the leaders, the completion of the worksheets was done asynchronously with the understanding that if there were major disagreements we would set up a teleconference to resolve; however, these were not needed. We had some difficulty getting agreement on the criteria and definitions from our stakeholder panel chairs. As mentioned above, some Stakeholder panel members reported that the wide range of interventions and outcomes made ranking difficult. If the Stakeholder Panels had included different stakeholders this could have changed the priority ranking for some stakeholders. However, since our Panels included diverse individuals and were based on consensus, we feel that the priority lists would have remained similar. Another limitation of our exercise is that we were mostly limited to Cochrane reviews, although the nutrition exercise included some non-Cochrane systematic reviews because the nutrition stakeholder panel chair identified these as interventions with important effects. The other topic areas used only Cochrane systematic reviews. Had additional reviews been included, the results of the exercise may have differed. However, for this exercise we aimed to conduct a priority setting exercise for interventions available in the Cochrane Library.</p><p id="Par55">This paper has focused on the priority setting methods for which the process began in 2013. Since the Cochrane Handbook has not been updated since then, we believe the methods described in this paper would be applicable to the current and future priority setting processes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Next steps</title><p id="Par56">Our literature will be updated annually and our E4E summaries will be linked to policy briefs provided through Health Systems Evidence (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.healthsystemsevidence.org">www.healthsystemsevidence.org</ext-link>), a database containing syntheses of research evidence about governance, financial and delivery arrangements within health systems, and implementation strategies. The summaries will also be linked to the International Initiative for Impact Evaluations (3ie) Briefs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.3ieimpact.org/en/evidence/briefs/">http://www.3ieimpact.org/en/evidence/briefs/</ext-link>), which answer policy questions using impact evaluation results.</p><p id="Par57">This priority-setting exercise will be used to identify Cochrane systematic reviews that will be summarized and added to the E4E Special Collection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://methods.cochrane.org/equity/e4e-series">http://methods.cochrane.org/equity/e4e-series</ext-link>) (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Screenshot of E4E Landing Page and Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Screenshot of HIV Topic Landing Page). To date, there are 25 pilot summaries available on the test website. We plan to conduct user testing of the pilot summaries and will revise the summaries based on the results, then develop new summaries for each of the top 10 interventions identified through the priority-setting exercise.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec50"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par58">This method provides an explicit approach to setting priorities by systematic review groups and funders for providing decision makers with evidence for the most important equity-relevant interventions. Sustainability of this E4E special collection will require partnering with Cochrane and Campbell review groups to continuously identify systematic reviews with potential for important impact on health equity. This could be implemented as part of knowledge translation strategies for these organizations. A first step might be to start with interested review groups, and particularly those covering topics that represent a high burden of disease in low and middle income countries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec11"><p>
