    "Background:Helicobacter pylori infects half of the world's population and causes gastric cancer in a subset of infected adults. Previous blood microarray findings showed that apparently healthy children, persistently infected with H. pylori have differential gene expression compared to age-matched, non-infected children. SLC5A8, a cancer suppressor gene with decreased expression among infected children, was chosen for further study based on bioinformatics analysis. Methods: A pilot study was conducted using specific qRT-PCR amplification of SLC5A8 in blood samples from H. pylori infected and non-infected children, followed by a larger, blinded, case-control study. We then analyzed gastric tissue from H. pylori infected and non-infected children undergoing endoscopy for clinical purposes. Results: Demographics, clinical findings, and family history were similar between groups. SLC5A8 expression was decreased in infected vs. non-infected children in blood, 0.12 (IQR: 0-0.89) vs. 1.86 (IQR: 0-8.94, P = 0.002), and in gastric tissue, 0.08 (IQR: 0.04-0.15) vs. 1.88 (IQR: 0.55-2.56; P = 0.001). Children who were both stool positive and seropositive for H. pylori had the lowest SLC5A8 expression levels. Conclusions:H. pylori infection is associated with suppression of SCL5A8, a cancer suppressor gene, in both blood and tissue samples from young children. Key Points: Young children, persistently infected with Helicobacter pylori show decreased expression of SLC5A8 mRNA in both blood and tissue samples as compared to non-infected children."
