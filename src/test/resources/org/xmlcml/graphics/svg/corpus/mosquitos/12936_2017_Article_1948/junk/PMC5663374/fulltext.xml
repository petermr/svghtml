Understanding this relationship among coastline communities at risk of flood events caused by storms and/or tsunamis, is important because hazard proximity, should be recognized when planning and implementing preparation and mitigation actions against these events. Yet, we are not aware of studies that have examined this relationship among coastline inhabitants facing the risk of a tsunami. Consequently, the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between hazard proximity and perceived risk from tsunamis among coastline inhabitants. Participants were 487 residents of the coastal city of Iquique, Chile. They completed a survey during the spring of 2013 that assessed their perceived risk from several natural and non-natural hazards. We found that hazard proximity maintains a negative relationship with the perception of tsunami risk among coastline inhabitants. While this result confirms the general trend obtained in previous studies, this one is conclusive and significant. In contradiction with previous findings, we found that participants from the highest socioeconomic status reported the highest levels of risk perception. This finding can be explained by the fact that most participants from the highest socioeconomic status live closer to the coastline areas, so their risk perception reflects the place where they live, that is in a tsunami inundation zone. Once again, hazard proximity proved to be a determinant factor of risk perception. Our findings have important implications for the development of plans and programs for tsunami preparedness and mitigation. These indicate that individuals do use environmental cues to evaluate their own risk and can potentially make correct choices when having or not to evacuate. Also suggest that preparedness should incorporate how hazard proximity is recognized by individuals and communities at risk.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient&#x000ed;fico y Tecnol&#x000f3;gico (CL)</institution></funding-source><award-id>1130864</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bronfman</surname><given-names>Nicol&#x000e1;s C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002848</institution-id><institution>Comisi&#x000f3;n Nacional de Investigaci&#x000f3;n Cient&#x000ed;fica y Tecnol&#x000f3;gica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15110017</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was partially funded by Chile&#x02019;s National Science and Technology Commission (Conicyt) through the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Research (Fondecyt, grant 1130864) and by the National Research Center for Integrated Natural Disaster Management CONICYT/FONDAP/15110017.

In the last two decades alone, more than 750,000 people lost their lives because of an earthquake or tsunami, and economic losses were close to 787 trillion US dollars [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Additionally, it is estimated that 13% of the urban population lives 10 meters or less above sea level, a number that it is expected to continue growing in the coming decades [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>This scenario makes urgent to prepare coastal communities to cope with these hazards in a timely and effective manner. Several authors have suggested that the motivation and willingness to take preventive actions are directly related to individual levels of risk perception [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Overall, they have concluded that the higher the perceived risk, the higher the probability that the individual is willing to take preventive actions to mitigate the associated risks [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186455.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Still, it has also been found that, in some cases, a higher perception of risk does not necessarily imply a greater willingness to take preparedness and mitigation actions against the occurrence of natural hazards [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186455.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This complex relationship reveals the importance to evaluate the role of other factors to further explain risk perception.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Risk perception and hazard proximity</title><p>Environmental cues are recognized among the factors that influence risk perception, showing that individuals incorporate their observations to assess their own risk [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In fact, proximity to technological hazards have been found to significantly influence perceived risk among individuals who face these hazards [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186455.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Early studies exploring this relationship on technological risks, such as nuclear power plants [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], chemical plants [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and transportation of hazardous substances [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], among others, have concluded that the closer to the hazard source the higher the perceived risk [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Recently, the relationship between hazard proximity and risk perception has interested researchers who have studied its role in relation to some natural hazards, mainly flooding riverbeds [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], coastline floods [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], volcanoes [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and earthquakes [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, their findings have not been consistent, while some researchers have found a positive relationship [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186455.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], others have failed to do so [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Lindell and Perry [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] argue that these contradictory findings reveal that in some scenarios people have limited ability to identify their location in hazardous areas, while in others they may have greater ability. For example, Arlikatti et al. [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] examined the accuracy with which 359 residents of the United States&#x000b4; west coast were able to locate their residence in risk maps for hurricanes. They found that only one third of the participants correctly identified their risk areas given their residential location.</p><p>Barberi et al., [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] evaluated risk perception among individuals living close to the Vesuvius volcano in Italy. The sample of 2,488 participants were divided into red and yellow zones, according to their hazard proximity. Participants living in the red zone reported greater risk perceptions as compared to those in the yellow zone. In other study, Lindell and Hwang [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] examined the relationship between hazard proximity, hazard experience and perceived personal risk for three hazards: flooding from rivers, hurricanes and chemical plants in a sample of 321 participants living in the United States. They found that risk perception was correlated with coastline (risk of hurricanes) and chemical plant proximity, but not with river proximity (flood risk). Their results provide evidence of a direct effect of proximity hazard on the risk perception for hurricanes and chemical hazards, but not for river flooding, and suggest that the nature of the hazard plays an important role when examining this relationship.</p><p>Similarly, Zhang et al., [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], evaluated how the housing price is affected by the relationship between hazard proximity and risk perception when facing natural and technological hazards, in a sample of 200 households in the United States. The correlation analyses revealed that the relationship between hazard proximity and risk perception regarding floods, hurricanes and chemical hazards is negative and statistically significant. Bubeck et al. [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], in a review of studies evaluating risk perception and precautionary behavior found that, in general, the distance to a river or a body of water exerts a small effect on current mitigation measures (such as flood insurance) adopted by people. These differences in findings suggest that the relationship between hazard proximity and risk perception may not be the same for all hazards, as has been proposed by Lindell and Perry [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The ability to recognize the threat may differ according to the nature of the hazard and maybe relevant to explore. The study of other natural hazards may help to better understand this relationship.</p><p>Despite the increased interest in studying the relationship between perceived risk and hazard proximity to natural disasters (mainly flooding due to weather events), to this date, we have not found studies examining this relationship among coastline inhabitants who face the risk of a tsunami. Studies in this area are essential because we know substantially less from tsunamis than others natural hazards such floods or hurricanes, and the fact that the location of the hazard may be easier to identify, may contribute to our understanding of the role of hazard proximity and risk perception [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Moreover, study whether, population living in risk zones for tsunamis in locations where the source of the tsunami that is close to the land and the time to issue an official warning is limited, recognize proximity of the hazard in their perception of risk, may contribute to inform and develop more effective preparedness actions. For example, inhabitants of coastal communities who were exposed to the 2015 Illapel earthquake and tsunami reported that the waves arrived between 2 [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and 12 minutes after the earthquake [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], giving very limited time for the official warning to be issued. Fortunately, no victims were reported: inhabitants evacuated voluntary and promptly after the earthquake. They rapidly recognized they were on a risk zone and needed to reach safety.</p><p>In fact, the hazard zone for a tsunami may be easier to identify as compared to other hazards involving bodies of water, however this is something that has not been addressed previously. This is the main gap we intend to address with the present study. Findings from this study could contribute to better understand the relationship between hazard proximity and risk perception. Consequently, the main objective of this study was to examine the relationship between hazard proximity and the perceived risk for tsunami among coastline residents. In line with previous studies, we expected residential location to be a determining factor of the public perception of risk from a tsunami; that is, that hazard proximity relates inversely and significantly with risk perception.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Risk perception and sociodemographic factors</title><p>The relationship between risk perception and sociodemographic factors such as age, gender and socioeconomic status has been widely studied in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186455.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In general, it has been found that women report greater perceived risk from natural hazards such as earthquakes [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], volcanoes [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and floods [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. With respect to age, the literature shows greater perception of risk from natural hazards among older people [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186455.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Regarding socioeconomic status, studies show that as the status of people increases, their perception of risk from natural hazards decreases [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186455.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These factors will be included as covariates in the present study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Chile and its coastline: The case study</title><p>Chile is a narrow strip of land between the Andes and the southeastern coast of the Pacific Ocean (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186455.g001">Fig 1</xref>). It comprises a length of 4,270 km. reaching a maximum width of 445 km. Chile is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is exposed to one of the highest frequency of occurrence of earthquakes and tsunamis. In the XXI century alone, 79 earthquakes of a magnitude &#x02265;7.0 on the Richter scale have occurred in Chile [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In fact, the largest earthquake ever recorded in history took place in the city of Valdivia in 1960, with a magnitude of 9.5 on the Richter scale (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186455.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The mega-event was due to a rupture of 1,000 km. in length, which significantly altered the geography of the affected area and triggered a destructive tsunami, with waves ranging between 10 and 15 meters [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which reached the coasts of Japan, the United States and Hawaii, among other places. In Chile, the effect was devastating. In 1960 the country's population was just over 7.3 million inhabitants [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This earthquake killed more than 2,000 people, affected about 2 million people and caused economic losses of more than 550 million dollars [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0186455.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0186455.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Map of Chile.</title><p>Twelve of the most destructive earthquakes in the history of Chile.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0186455.g001"/></fig><p>The coastline cities of Chile most frequently affected by earthquakes and/or tsunamis are in the northern and central region. Iquique, located in the north of the Chilean coast is one of these cities (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186455.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The largest seismic event recorded in the area corresponds to a megathrust earthquake of 8.8 magnitude on Richter scale, which occurred in 1877 and generated a tsunami with waves between 9 and 14 meters high [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Because of insufficient seismic activity, the scientific community has predicted the occurrence of a seismic event of great magnitude in the subduction zone adjacent to northern Chile [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and expect that this may occur sometime soon.</p><p>In fact, on April 2014, an earthquake of an 8.2 magnitude on Richter scale shook the city of Iquique. The event killed six people and more than 13,000 homes were affected. Economic losses were estimated at 100 million USD. While at one point, the public thought it was the great earthquake foreshadowed by the scientific community, researchers, however suggested the opposite. In fact, Hayes and colleagues concluded that "&#x02026;Significant sections of the northern Chile subduction zone have not ruptured in almost 150 years, so it is likely that future megathrust earthquakes will occur to the south and potentially to the north of the 2014 Iquique sequence."

This study was implemented in five major cities in Chile: Iquique, Antofagasta, Valpara&#x000ed;so, Santiago and Concepci&#x000f3;n. The sample was stratified by gender, socioeconomic status and age, and was representative of each five cities. A total of 2,054 face-to-face interviews were held in the homes of each participant.</p><p>The questionnaire included three sections. The first section measured risk perception and the degree of acceptability regarding 40 hazards grouped into eight categories: (1) five transportation hazards, (2) four forbidden or addictive substances, (3) four social ills, (4) four environmental hazards, (5) four chemical products and substances, (6) six technological hazards, (7) nine natural hazards and (8) four other hazards. The risk perception measure used was designed based on previous studies that have addressed similar problems [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186455.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], within the psychometric tradition [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

Thus, shorter distances from the coastline result in higher risk perception. This result confirms the general trend obtained in previous studies that have examined this relationship [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186455.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186455.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186455.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>These conclusive results may be explained by the greater ability of the inhabitants studied to recognize their proximity to the hazard, as compared to participants in previous studies focusing on other natural hazards [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186455.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Several factors may explain this greater hazard proximity recognition, such as visibility of hazard, previous experience and available information. People residing in the city of Iquique live, work and perform their daily activities on the coast. They have also experienced earthquakes and tsunamis previously. Their previous experience with earthquakes and tsunamis may facilitate their ability to recognize their proximity with this hazard. Also, the actions taken by local authorities and experts in order to keep the population aware and prepare, have probably contributed to their ability to recognize the hazard. This is a significant finding because it provides more evidence of the relevance of the nature of the hazard when studying the role of hazard proximity on risk perception, and contributes to understand the contradictory findings reported previously.</p><p>While this increased public concern about the risk of earthquakes and tsunamis would increase the willingness to take preventive actions to mitigate the associated risks [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], it could also may have potential negative consequences when a tsunami evacuation occurs [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Residents living in a safe area who have high risk perception could potentially evacuate to higher areas (shadow evacuation), blocking escape routes for those coming from flood risk areas [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This could be potentially catastrophic in situations where the evacuation is carried out mainly in cars, blocking evacuation routes and hindering the flow of people. Thus, our results reveal that the people&#x02019;s recognition of the hazard proximity is crucial for the tsunami evacuation process and should be taken into account when planning and implementing tsunami evacuation plans and programs.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that women report greater risk perception of natural hazards as compared to men [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186455.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186455.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Unexpectedly, our results showed no significant differences between men and women, regardless of the area of residence of the participant. It is possible that the scale used was not able to capture these gender differences; possibly the measurement scale used was not wide enough to display these differences. In fact, the high scores reported in risk perception (at the upper limit of the scale) by both men and women in the present study could also have limited the possibility to detect gender differences. Future studies should further examine gender differences incorporating additional measures of risk perception.</p><p>Consistent with previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186455.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], older participants living in safe areas reported higher risk perception. Additionally, we found that people 29 and under living in safe areas showed a significantly lower risk perception than people of the same age group living in a tsunami flood zone. This may also be explained by the effect of hazard proximity, but also may suggest that actions taken to prepare the communities may be reaching younger population. This is particularly concerning since older adults are considered vulnerable and present difficulties to successfully cope with disasters [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Actions aimed to target older adults to prepare them to effectively cope with a potential tsunami are necessary.</p><p>Surprisingly, participants from higher socioeconomic status groups reported overall higher risk perception as compared to residents of lower socioeconomic status. This result contradicts findings from previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186455.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This result, however, reflects the place where these participants live. Most participants from the highest socioeconomic status live closer to the coastline areas, so their higher risk perception may reflect their actual location. Thus, hazard proximity proved to be a significant influential factor in risk perception, even changing the traditional difference found in previous studies for socioeconomic status. Nevertheless, to further understand this relationship, longitudinal studies should be conducted in order to examine how risk perception changes over time and the role that taking actions to prepare and mitigate for these hazards could have on the perceived risk [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Our results provide evidence of the need to consider the role of hazard proximity both for the study of risk perception as well for the preparation of communities exposed to natural hazards. It also recognizes that communities and individuals recognize these risks and use environmental information to effectively cope with natural hazards, such as earthquakes and tsunamis that cannot be accurately predicted. Our results also reveal that hazard proximity should be actively incorporated in the strategies aimed to prepared communities and in the development of risk communication plans, particularly in a tsunami scenario, where non-structural mitigation efforts are very relevant to prevent unnecessary casualties. They also suggest that preparation actions should build on what individuals and communities have learned from past events and explicitly identify the hazard zone and its nature. These actions should build from already implemented actions aimed to provide hazard zone maps to the public. Keeping the inhabitants of Iquique aware of their risk through several actions appear to have helped to maintain them alert and reporting high risk perception. Moreover, the differences between groups, should also be considered when targeting groups that are at risk because they are less likely to evacuate or potentially do it when it is not required, and groups that decide to evacuate when is not required.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Limitations</title><p>Some limitations of the present study must be recognized. We assessed risk perception in one moment in time and therefore we cannot conclude there is a casual relationship between the two main study variables [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We also used a limited number of items that focused on the public perception of risks (10). However, the risk perception model used in this study has a long-standing tradition [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186455.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This approach asks participants to evaluate risks from a long list of scenarios. In the present study, we use two questions to evaluate the social perception of risk, and ask participants directly to evaluate the national population risk as consequence of (i) an earthquake and (ii) a tsunami. Risk attributes as voluntariness, event frequency of occurrence, severity of the consequences, familiarity, social degree of knowledge, dread and catastrophic potential, among others, are important elements that influence the people&#x02019;s risk judgments and they should be considered in future studies.</p><p>Our results, however, are consistent with findings from previous studies focusing on hazard proximity and risk perception, with studies have also measured risk perception with two items [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The fact that we used measures that have been previously by other researchers in the field and that most of our findings are consistent with previous studies, suggest that, despite these limitations, our findings are useful to further understand the role of hazard proximity in risk perception to natural hazards. Nevertheless, future studies could incorporate measures of risk perception that include other dimensions, could allow to contribute to better understand the role of hazard proximity in relation to risk perception.</p><p>Participants in the study were from a coastal city in Chile that may not be representative of other individuals exposed to similar hazards in other places around the world. The fact that the fault is near to the city and inhabitants have been exposed to these events previously makes them a particularly interesting group to study: they may be well-aware of the hazard and recognize the risk. Differences in findings can be explained by the type of hazard studied, particularly the fact that tsunami risk zone maybe easier to identify as compared to others, and this greater awareness [<xref rid="pone.0186455.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec011"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0186455.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Data set used in the research.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0186455.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0186455.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><collab>CRED</collab>. <chapter-title>Human Cost of Natural Disasters</chapter-title>
