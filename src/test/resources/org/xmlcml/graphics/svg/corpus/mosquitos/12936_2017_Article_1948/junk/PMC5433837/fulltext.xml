Then, after instillation of proparacaine 0.5%, a bipolar Burian-Allen electrode (Hansen Ophthalmic Development Lab, Coralville, IA, USA) was placed on the cornea of one eye, chosen at random. A ground electrode was placed on the skin over the ipsilateral mastoid. Responses were differentially amplified (bandpass, 0.3 to 100 Hz; gain, 100,000), digitized, and displayed using the VERIS multifocal system (EDI, Redwood City, CA, USA). The input signal from the electrode was monitored, and segments contaminated by noise were rejected and recorded again.</p><p>Responses were recorded to an array of 103 hexagons scaled by eccentricity and centered on a fixation cross that subtended 1&#x000b0;. The total horizontal extent of the array was 45&#x000b0;.

The average luminance of the stimulus was &#x0223c;100 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, and the contrast between the white and black hexagons was &#x0003e;90%. Each hexagon alternated between white and black using a random m sequence with exponent 14. Thus, each hexagon in the pattern changed 2<sup>14&#x02212;1</sup> times during a 4-minute recording period that was divided into 12 segments. Fifty-one subjects were tested using a high-resolution stimulator with a fixation monitoring system (EDI) that uses a liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) display. Eight subjects were tested with stimuli presented on a high-resolution Visual Graphics Array (VGA) monitor (Nortech Imaging Technologies, Mount Prospect, IL, USA). Stimulus parameters (luminance, contrast, and spatial extent) were identical in the two devices. We compared responses from 17 control subjects tested with the FMS stimulator to responses from 14 control subjects tested with the VGA monitor and found no systematic differences in P1 amplitude or latency between the two groups. Therefore, data obtained using the two stimulators have been combined.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Analyses</title><p>Responses to the stimuli were processed using the VERIS software (version 6.4.4; EDI) with one iteration of artifact removal and spatial averaging with one-sixth of the surrounding responses.

This is evidence that the late maturing central retina, which includes the fovea and mediates the mfERG response, is vulnerable to the effects of prematurity. Other evidence of the central retina's vulnerability to prematurity, even in the absence of a history of ROP, has been demonstrated by OCT studies of the macula.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> These studies showed thickening of the postreceptor laminae, which is interpretable as a failure of centrifugal migration of postreceptor cells that occurs in normal development.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>The mfERG responses in severe ROP were significantly smaller than in any other group. The attenuated mfERG response in severe ROP cannot be a direct effect of the antecedent laser treatment; there is no physical overlap of the laser spots and the retinal region tested by the mfERG stimulus (radius, 22.5&#x000b0;). The combined impacts of laser, ROP, and prematurity on the mfERG cannot be specified at this time.</p><p>We are aware of three prior studies of mfERG responses in subjects with a history of preterm birth.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> All three studies conclude that mfERG amplitude in preterms is smaller than in term-born controls, but assessment of the effect of ROP severity on the mfERG was not done. The present study was organized to make that comparison. Our 2005 study showed that mfERG amplitude was reduced in mild ROP subjects compared with term-born controls.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Michalczuk et al.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> found that P1 differed significantly between severe ROP and no ROP subjects only in the most central ring, ring 1. Akerblom et al.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> found that amplitude did not differ between those who had ROP (mild and severe groups combined) and those in the no ROP category. Thus, although it is clear that responses in preterms were smaller than in term born subjects in all studies, it was not possible to evaluate the effect of ROP severity from the previously published data.</p><p>The mfERG response is a complex waveform that combines contributions from the cone photoreceptors and potentials from cone ON and OFF bipolar cells of the postreceptor retina.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Photoreceptors are thought to contribute to N1 in the central 6&#x000b0; that includes rings 1 and 2.

Thus, low N1 amplitude may be a consequence of low cone photoreceptor sensitivity in severe ROP as previously shown by full-field electroretinography.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>The mfERG P1 component is formed by interaction of recovery of the photoreceptor response and potentials associated with depolarization and recovery of cone ON and OFF bipolar cells.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> P1 amplitude was lower in the former preterm subjects than in the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-f03">Fig. 3</xref>, lower panel). One possibility is that the reduced P1 amplitude may be a consequence of damage to the cones.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Recovery of the cone photoreceptor response may be slower than normal in ROP, as it is for rod deactivation.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> We had previously shown by adaptive optics imaging of extrafoveal cones that the optical properties of cones in severe ROP were altered.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Perhaps the cones are dysmorphic, as were the rods in a rat model of ROP.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> The relative balance of cone driven ON and OFF bipolar activity may be altered by ROP, but evidence of an ON&#x02013;OFF imbalance was not found by full-field electroretinography.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Possibly, the imbalance could be elucidated by using other mfERG stimulus sequences.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>Our results provide evidence that premature birth alone has an effect on central retinal function and that, among those diagnosed with ROP in infancy, the magnitude of the effect varies with severity of the antecedent ROP. The lack of difference in mfERG amplitude between the mild and no ROP groups is evidence that the effect on the neurosensory retina does not depend solely on categorization of ROP, which is based on appearance of the retinal vasculature at the time of examination in the nursery with no regard to assessment of the neurosensory retina. Investigation of visual threshold in the regions of altered mfERG function may help further define the effects of prematurity on the neurosensory retina. Use of adaptive optics imaging methods<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2603-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> have identified subclinical changes in the microvasculature in mild ROP subjects. These may well be present subjects without ROP but, to our knowledge, have not been reported.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Jennifer Bush and Rotem Kimia for assistance.</p><p>Supported by National Eye Institute Grant R01 EY-010597 and the Massachusetts Lions Eye Research Fund.</p><p>Disclosure: <bold>P.
