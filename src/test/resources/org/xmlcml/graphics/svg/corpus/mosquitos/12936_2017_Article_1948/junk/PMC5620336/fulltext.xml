Among the poorest quintile of women, insured women had an mCPR 16.5 percentage points higher than that of uninsured women, suggesting that expansion of insurance coverage is associated with increased family planning access and use. In the high- and upper-middle-income countries we reviewed, all modern contraceptive methods are typically available through the social health insurance schemes that cover a majority of the population.

Through these steps, countries can increase financial protection for family planning and better ensure the right to health of poor and marginalized populations.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Over the past 50 years, countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) have successfully expanded access to family planning services. The modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) has increased in every country in the LAC region, and by more than 30 percentage points in countries such as El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, and Peru.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> For 2015, the mCPR for the region is estimated at 66.7%, and unmet need for family planning is estimated at 10.7%.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> The region has seen corresponding decreases in the total fertility rate, which has fallen from 5&#x02013;6 children per woman to just 2.2, nearing the replacement fertility level of 2.1. This decline was driven by improvements in access to family planning services, such as the subsidized provision of contraceptives through social marketing and the inclusion of family planning services in the basic package of services provided by government-supported health facilities. Over this period, support from international organizations and donors, including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the International Planned Parenthood Federation, and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), was critical in strengthening family planning programs. Improvements in education, income levels, and infant and child mortality rates have further contributed to the decline in the total fertility rate.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p><boxed-text position="float"><p>Access to family planning in Latin America has resulted in increased use of modern methods and decreases in the total fertility rate.</p></boxed-text><p>The success of family planning programs in many LAC countries did not occur overnight, but has rather been part of a steady process of development of countries' health systems as they advance toward universal health coverage (UHC). In recent decades, many LAC countries have recognized health as a fundamental&#x02014;and often constitutional&#x02014;right of their citizens and embraced the goals of UHC.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> (A review of this process in the LAC region is beyond the scope of this paper.) UHC implies an assurance of financial protection against the cost of health care (i.e., the ability to access services without facing financial hardship) and provision of quality services across a full range of promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, and palliative interventions, for all people.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Such services can be provided through any variety of health financing and delivery channels, including social or private health insurance and public or private facilities.</p><p>As part of the movement toward UHC, many countries in the LAC region made efforts to reform their health financing to increase the pooling of funds, guaranteed access to an essential package of services, and financial protection from the cost of health services for the vulnerable. These reforms were based on other, longer-term efforts in primary health care strengthening, regulation, and social mobilization. Broadly, LAC countries have used 3 types of financing mechanisms&#x02014;which this paper henceforth refers to as UHC-oriented schemes&#x02014;as the means to further these goals:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Social health insurance</p></list-item><list-item><p>Private health insurance</p></list-item><list-item><p>Public tax-funded provision</p></list-item></list></p><p>Social health insurance (SHI) schemes have been a primary mechanism for increasing health insurance coverage in many LAC countries. These schemes are state-supported and are typically financed through payroll contributions from formal-sector workers. In addition to these &#x0201c;contributory&#x0201d; schemes, high- and upper-middle-income countries in the region have expanded SHI to include &#x0201c;subsidized&#x0201d; schemes, with the state subsidizing enrollment for informal workers and the poor.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Such subsidized schemes ensure greater financial protection and a higher quality of services for poor and vulnerable populations.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> On occasion, governments have set up and substantially financed autonomous insurance schemes focused on the poor, for example in Peru. Henceforth, this paper refers to these as &#x0201c;other government-supported schemes.&#x0201d; Private health insurance (PHI) plays only a small role in health financing in LAC countries and covers mainly higher-income individuals. These PHI schemes can be stand-alone or supplementary to SHI. They are usually supported by voluntary contributions from formal-sector employees and/or their employers, or from those with otherwise higher income status.</p><boxed-text position="float"><p>State-supported social health insurance has been a mechanism for increasing health care coverage in the region.</p></boxed-text><p>Many governments continue to provide health services through public facilities, often for free. The idea of a comprehensive public health care network financed through tax revenue and provided free to all residents (similar to the National Health Service model in the United Kingdom) represents theoretically near-universal financial protection from the cost of health care. In practice in many LAC countries, particularly lower-income countries, free provision is insufficient, alone, to ensure adequate range and quality of services. These limitations to public tax-funded provision, within the context of family planning services, are discussed in this article. Additional health financing modalities may, therefore, be needed to cover all population groups and sufficiently meet the goals of UHC.</p><boxed-text position="float"><p>In practice, free provision of health services at public facilities is not enough to ensure people's access to a sufficient range of services.</p></boxed-text><p>SHI is the primary mechanism for health sector financing in much of the LAC region, and the term &#x0201c;social health insurance&#x0201d; is often used interchangeably with the term &#x0201c;universal health coverage.&#x0201d; However, it is important to note that SHI arose separately from and before broad, UHC-oriented efforts. Nascent SHI schemes in LAC began with a focus on hospital care, curative interventions, and protection against catastrophic health care expenditures.<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Only with the recent adoption of explicit UHC-oriented goals has the focus begun to shift to include primary and preventive services, including family planning.</p><p>Before their SHI schemes matured, some countries' family planning programs benefited from high levels of sustained external support, primarily from USAID.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Improvements in family planning access over the 1990s and 2000s in many LAC countries were due to a variety of factors and not only the expansion of UHC-oriented schemes.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> However, integration of family planning into UHC-oriented efforts has been suggested as a possible way to continue the improvement in family planning access and use<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> as well as to provide sustainable family planning financing in countries with high mCPR, especially where external financing has tapered off (this is referred to as &#x0201c;graduation&#x0201d;).</p><p>Theoretically, UHC-oriented schemes, including SHI, should promote financial protection in the context of the cost of family planning&#x02014;if the related benefits are included in the scheme&#x02014;by increasing prepayment and by subsidizing fully or partially the cost of health services, including premium payments, for some groups. This can help ensure effective family planning access for poor and vulnerable women, including those from indigenous groups. Examining recent evidence can help to determine if this has been the case in countries with mature family planning and UHC programs functioning in parallel, as well as to discern lessons from and for other countries on the path to UHC.</p><boxed-text position="float"><p>Theoretically, UHC-oriented schemes can help ensure that poor and marginalized women, including indigenous women, have access to family planning.</p></boxed-text><p>Many LAC countries, especially in Central America and the Caribbean, have recently graduated from or are currently facing graduation from external support for family planning. There is thus a need to consider long-term plans for sustainably financing the scale-up of family planning access and use. For these countries, learning about the recent links between family planning access and UHC-oriented health insurance schemes in the region becomes critical.</p><p>However, despite extensive literature on both UHC and family planning progress in LAC countries, as well as on the recent family planning graduation of some LAC countries, little analysis exists to link ongoing family planning efforts to the broader LAC UHC agenda. The purpose of our analysis is therefore to better understand the relationship between the coverage of UHC-oriented schemes and family planning. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to systematically examine the status of family planning within UHC schemes. Including family planning within UHC-oriented schemes involves not only legal status (i.e., the inclusion of family planning in the benefits package), but also the consistent availability of family planning both within and across facilities, the availability of a range of methods, and appropriate co-pays (i.e., co-pays that do not expose clients to financial hardship) for accessing contraceptive methods.</p><boxed-text position="float"><p>The purpose of this analysis is to understand the relationship between universal health care coverage and family planning.</p></boxed-text><p>By considering family planning in the context of UHC, LAC and other countries may make more informed decisions on how to integrate family planning into UHC-oriented schemes. Our analysis examines the following key questions for a selected sample of countries in the LAC region:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>What is the current level of coverage for SHI and other risk-pooling mechanisms, and how does this vary by geography, ethnicity, and income level?

A full list of the indicators used is available in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ghspjournal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.9745/GHSP-D-17-00057/-/DCSupplemental">Supplement 1</ext-link>.</p><p>The team performed a desk review of existing literature on family planning and health financing in the countries of interest, and in LAC broadly.

These interviews informed our assessment of the current status and inclusion of contraceptive methods within public health service provision and SHI and PHI schemes.

Generally, countries with the largest indigenous populations reported the greatest inequities. Costa Rica and Colombia, with smaller indigenous populations, have achieved substantial success in the expansion of family planning. However, they still face some challenges in reaching their poor and indigenous populations. To address these inequities, many LAC countries are beginning to take steps to address sociocultural barriers to family planning uptake among indigenous women. Strategies have included using tailored demand creation strategies such as peer promotion, culturally appropriate communication and behavior change strategies, integration of family planning with water and sanitation projects, and cash transfer programs.<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr"><sup>56</sup></xref></p><boxed-text position="float"><p>Across countries reviewed, modern contraceptive use was lowest among the most vulnerable and marginalized populations, particularly indigenous, poor, and uninsured women.</p></boxed-text><p>The modern contraceptive method mix varied across countries in our sample in ways that may not always be representative of the LAC region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>).

Notably, the countries with high insurance coverage and benefits that included all major modern contraceptive methods did not necessarily exhibit a more diverse method mix. For example, in Chile the top 2 methods accounted for 89% of the method mix.

In some of these countries with dual-track schemes (e.g., Chile and Colombia), enrollees in the contributory scheme had access to a broader range of health facilities, including the private sector, compared with enrollees in the subsidized scheme. However, in most countries, the packages of services in the SHI scheme have over time been equalized across all covered individuals, and usually include all major family planning methods. The SHI schemes in Guatemala, Haiti, and Honduras remain contributory only (i.e., limited to public and other formal sector employees who pay in). In these countries, less than 20% of the population is covered by an SHI scheme (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tabu1">Table</xref>).</p><boxed-text position="float"><p>8 of the 9 countries in our sample have some form of state-supported health insurance scheme.</p></boxed-text><p>Coverage through private insurers was limited within our sample. PHI coverage was less than 10% in 6 of the 9 countries; Chile was the only country to explicitly incorporate PHI schemes into its UHC agenda (with ISAPRES). Due to low total insurance coverage rates in some of our sampled countries, on average, nearly half of the people across the sample relied on public services or OOP payment for health care. Reliance on public health services or OOP spending was particularly high in Central America and the Caribbean. Although usually provided free of charge, public health services frequently face insufficient funding and stock-outs of essential medicines and supplies, which result in implicit rationing and poor quality of care.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr"><sup>59</sup></xref> Many uninsured people, therefore, are forced to pay OOP for health services in private facilities or pharmacies. For the poor&#x02014;who are also less likely to be enrolled in SHI due to informal employment or unemployment&#x02014;these costs can cause substantial financial hardship.</p></sec><sec id="s4.4"><title>Family Planning Inclusion in UHC-Oriented Schemes</title><p>Our study found that family planning services have been relatively well-integrated into UHC-oriented schemes. However, variation exists across both countries and schemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3</xref>). Eight of the 9 countries in the study provided public family planning services for free, typically in facilities operated by the ministry of health, typically catering to the uninsured. Only in Costa Rica were family planning services in public facilities limited to those enrolled in formal insurance schemes. In theory, the family planning services provided included all or most major contraceptive methods, yet not all facilities were equipped to provide all methods, and stock-outs were a major problem in many facilities and countries, particularly in low- and lower-middle-income countries. As a result, many uninsured clients were forced to pay OOP for family planning commodities in the private sector.</p><boxed-text position="float"><p>Family planning services have been relatively well-integrated into UHC-oriented schemes in LAC countries.</p></boxed-text><p>Coverage of family planning under government-supported SHI schemes varied substantially by countries' income level. In 5 of the 6 high- and upper-middle-income countries in our sample, the SHI schemes comprehensively covered family planning services (Jamaica was the exception). Generally, co-pays or user fees were not required. Some facilities did experience implicit rationing due to wait times, referrals, and sporadic stock-outs. In the 2 lower-middle-income countries in our sample, SHI schemes generally did not provide sufficient family planning coverage; they either provided a limited range of methods (Guatemala) or required clients to pay for FP fully OOP (Honduras) in scheme-linked facilities.</p><boxed-text position="float"><p>Family planning coverage varied substantially by countries' income level.</p></boxed-text><p>PHI played a relatively minor role in purchasing of family planning services, with Chile and Colombia being the only 2 countries in our sample where PHI regularly covered family planning. In other countries, sterilization was the only method regularly covered by private schemes.</p><p>Across our sample of countries, clients who paid OOP for contraceptive commodities faced costs ranging from $1 to more than $200 per couple-year of protection (personal communication, Karin Vrijburg, Researcher, NIDI, and Erik Beekink, Project leader, UNFPA-NIDI Resource Flows Project on Family Planning, NIDI, June, 2016). Permanent contraceptive procedures (i.e., sterilization) and long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, such as IUDs, tended to have the lowest costs per couple-year of protection but often carried large up-front OOP costs due to the need for facility-based services. In some countries, facility-based services, such as sterilization, had a one-time cost of more than $300, which presents a substantial financial barrier to poor clients. Data on the OOP cost of implants were lacking, which may present a lower-cost alternative to other long-acting methods. However, implants accounted for, on average, 2% of contraceptive method use in our sample of counties, and just 0.2% regionally. High OOP costs overall highlight the importance of financial protection for family planning for the poorest clients as well as the potential value of SHI and other UHC-oriented schemes in improving access and equity in family planning programs.</p><p>Our analysis does not attempt to draw a causal link between coverage status under UHC-oriented schemes and family planning use. We found that enrollment in government-supported insurance schemes (rather than reliance on public provision through ministry of health facilities), and particularly in SHI schemes, was associated with improved access to and uptake of modern family planning methods. In the 4 countries where population-level data were available, insured women, on average, had a mCPR 5.1 percentage points higher than uninsured women. The relationship between insurance coverage and family planning use appeared to be even more pronounced among the most financially vulnerable women (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Figure 5</xref>). Among the poorest quintile of women, insured women had an mCPR 16.5 percentage points higher than those that were uninsured. Unsurprisingly, among uninsured women, the average mCPR in the highest income quintile was 10.5 percentage points higher than in the lowest. Paradoxically, among insured women, mCPR was actually higher on average&#x02014;by 2.7 percentage points&#x02014;among the poorest women than the wealthiest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Figure 5</xref>). In some cases, such as in the Dominican Republic, this may be due to the failure of PHI plans, which typically cover wealthier beneficiaries, to include family planning in their benefits package.</p><boxed-text position="float"><p>Enrollment in government-supported insurance schemes (rather than reliance on public health facilities) was associated with improved access to and uptake of modern family planning methods.</p></boxed-text><boxed-text position="float"><p>Among the poorest quintile of women, insured women had a modern contraceptive prevalence rate16.5 percentage points higher than those that were uninsured.</p></boxed-text></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</title><p>In the sample of high- and upper-middle-income LAC countries we studied, SHI and other government-supported health insurance schemes have been the major conduit for implementation of UHC goals. These schemes have been, by and large, successful in integrating family planning services into their benefits packages. In sampled low- and lower-middle-income countries, where the SHI schemes remain confined to public and formal sector employees, inclusion of family planning services as benefits has been limited and sporadic. Family planning users in low- and lower-middle-income countries remain primarily dependent on public facilities and OOP payment for family planning services. As a result, poor and marginalized clients often continue to face financial hardship when seeking family planning services.</p><p>SHI and allied insurance schemes do present a pathway for further improvements in family planning access and use, alongside ensuring sustainable financing of family planning programs in LAC. Particularly in lower-middle-income countries, expansion of SHI beyond the formal sector must also be accompanied by the explicit inclusion of comprehensive family planning services within the benefits package. At the same time, although PHI covers only a small portion of the population in most LAC countries, better family planning coverage (i.e., inclusion in benefits packages and expanded choice of methods) by these schemes can help to diversify choice and provide options for non-poor informal-sector workers who must otherwise seek services in potentially overwhelmed public facilities. Countries will need to take a comprehensive view of UHC&#x02014;not only as SHI-led but also as encompassing both public provision and private insurance&#x02014;to achieve sustainable financing of family planning.</p><boxed-text position="float"><p>Better inclusion of family planning in private health insurance schemes can help to diversify method choice and provide options for informal-sector workers.</p></boxed-text><p>Albeit with caveats, the broad success of several LAC countries in simultaneously scaling up both family planning and SHI programs can serve as an example to other countries, both within and outside the region, as they consider including equitable family planning access in their UHC goals. However, SHI and other government-supported schemes are not a panacea for increasing family planning access and ensuring sustainable family planning financing. Our analysis does not infer any causal relationship between increase in health insurance coverage and improved access to family planning or increased use of modern methods. However, this study suggests that for insurance schemes&#x02014;public and private and other (i.e., provision of services by the ministry of health)&#x02014;to positively impact family planning uptake and sustainability, deliberate and explicit steps must be taken to ensure family planning is included in these schemes.</p><boxed-text position="float"><p>Deliberate and explicit steps must be taken to ensure family planning is included in UHC-oriented schemes.</p></boxed-text><p>For a relationship between insurance coverage and family planning access to exist, insurance schemes must (1) target poor and informal sector populations, for whom OOP spending on family planning presents a substantial financial barrier; (2) include family planning, either explicitly or implicitly, in the covered package of services; (3) ensure sufficient human resources and commodities to prevent stock-outs and implicit rationing of family planning services (if services and commodities are provided through the public sector), or ensure that reimbursements for family planning services include commodities (if commodities are purchased by providers) and are sufficient to ensure availability of both services and method choice; and (4) reduce nonfinancial barriers to access, including those due to geography, cultural factors, service quality, and range of methods, to ensure that couples can use their insurance to access their preferred contraceptive method. In many countries, scale-up of insurance schemes will coexist with government provision of services, especially to the poor, through public facilities. In those contexts, it will also be critical to ensure that enrollees in formal insurance schemes are not funneled to public facilities, causing crowding out of services for the uninsured.</p><boxed-text position="float"><p>When those covered by insurance are sent to public facilities for family planning methods, overcrowding leads to lack of access for the uninsured.</p></boxed-text><p>A limitation of our study, driven by resources, is that we did not look closely at variations in purchasing methods for family planning services (e.g., whether family planning was included under capitation or was purchased fee-for-service) under SHI and other government-supported schemes. Purchasing methods have influence on provider incentives and can affect access to and inclusion of family planning services.</p><p>This analysis constitutes a first step in associating family planning with UHC progress, particularly in LAC. Financing-related analyses are only part of the set of studies required to situate sustainable family planning programs within the context of UHC, particularly as many countries continue to transition from external to domestic funding sources. While many LAC countries have adopted a view of health as a fundamental right of citizens and have allocated funds to ensure access to services for poor and vulnerable populations, there remain unique challenges that continue to limit access to family planning. Full implementation of a rights-based approach to health will require nuanced strategies for including family planning in SHI and other UHC-oriented schemes. Although countries beyond LAC can learn lessons from the overall success and limitation of family planning-UHC linkages in the region, LAC countries with lagging family planning indicators can also apply these lessons to address gaps in family planning inclusion in their own SHI and UHC-oriented schemes.</p><boxed-text position="float"><p>Unique challenges remain in LAC countries to improve access to family planning.</p></boxed-text></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the contributions of Dr. Sonia Anderson (CapacityPlus, Dominican Republic), Julio Zu&#x000f1;iga (PASMO, Honduras), Carlos Leonel G&#x000f3;mez (PASMO, Guatemala), Marisela de la Cruz (Health Policy Plus, Guatemala), Nora Quesada (John Snow, Inc., Colombia), Daniel Aspilcueta (Ministry of Health, Peru), and Eduardo Soto Fernandez (Ministry of Health, Chile), who agreed to be interviewed for this study and whose expert opinion helped to inform our research.
