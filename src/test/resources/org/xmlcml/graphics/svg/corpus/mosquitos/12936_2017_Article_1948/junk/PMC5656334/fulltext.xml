</p><p>In 2014, at the 53<sup>rd</sup> Directing Council of the Pan American Health
Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), the countries of the Region of the
Americas reaffirmed their commitment to the Strategy of Universal Access to Health and
Universal Health Coverage (Universal Health)<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. Improvements in primary care resolution capacity, and the distribution,
training, and qualification of human resources for health, are important factors in
achieving Universal Health in the Region<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>There are several obstacles to access universal, comprehensive, good-quality health
services in the Region of the Americas<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. Despite advances in economic and social development and the consequent
strengthening of health systems in the Region, collaboration across health, education,
and labor sectors needs to be better aligned to promote education that will prepare
professionals to meet the health needs of the population and the countries<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Interprofessional collaboration is a promising strategy for mitigating the workforce
crisis and improving health care that, if carried out by interprofessional health teams,
enables optimization of skills and holistic, high-quality, people-centered care<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Effective collaboration among health team members requires health professional education
based on the interprofessional education (IPE) approach. As defined by the WHO, IPE
&#x0201c;occurs when students from two or more professions learn about, from and with each other
to enable effective collaboration and improve health outcomes&#x0201d;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Evidence indicates that IPE 1) promotes the development of attitudes, knowledge, skills,
and behaviors conducive to collaborative practice and 2) improves teamwork by developing
respect for and recognition of individuals&#x02019; skills<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>. This type of training enables health professionals to use the full capacity of
their training<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. If used throughout professional training rather than as isolated components of
the educational curriculum, IPE can strengthen health sector human resources capacity,
improve outcomes, and thus strengthen health systems<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>. Therefore, WHO recommends that educational establishments adapt their
institutional structures and teaching modalities to promote both IPE and collaborative
practice<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>In 2016, PAHO/WHO held a meeting in Bogota, Colombia (&#x0201c;Interprofessional Education in
Healthcare: Improving Human Resources Capacity to Achieve Universal Health&#x0201d;), to support
countries in the Region in the implementation or strengthening of IPE. Meeting
participants included representatives from ministries of health and education, academic
institutions, school associations, and professional associations in 12 countries:
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama,
Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, and Uruguay.</p><p>With the support of IPE experts from Canada, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United
States, meeting participants discussed the rationale and foundation for IPE, as well as
its theoretical, practical, and political frameworks; the individual and institutional
attributes, resources, and commitments required for its implementation; faculty
development for IPE; IPE curriculum development and implementation; the regulation of
health professionals within the IPE context; and aspects related to interprofessional
team management. Participants also presented and exchanged information about their
experiences with IPE in various countries of the Region.</p><p>An important outcome of the meeting was the launch of the Regional Network of
Interprofessional Health Education, coordinated by Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, with
the participation of several other countries in the Region of the Americas. The regional
network aims to 1) propose activities for developing IPE within the context of Universal
Health; 2) provide a forum for the exchange and dissemination of IPE information,
including experiences, knowledge, scientific evidence, as well as methods and resources
for teaching and conducting research; 3) identify common IPE facilitators and barriers;
4) encourage the development of intersectoral and multicenter research; 5) monitor the
status of IPE and related trends in health to facilitate priority setting related to IPE
and its development; 6) support the articulation between interprofessional education and
practice; and 7) monitor and support of countries activities. Additional meetings have
already been held to discuss network activities and subsequent steps.</p><p>After the meeting in Bogot&#x000e1;, six countries-Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa
Rica, and Uruguay-presented action plans for implementing or developing activities to
advance IPE through joint work between ministries of health, ministries of education,
academic institutions, school associations, and professional associations. Proposed
activities included analysis of the current status of IPE; conceptual alignment and
dissemination; identification of interested partners for IPE projects/research;
encouragement of IPE initiatives; faculty development for EIP; promotion of the IPE
theme in continuing health education; IPE related knowledge production and
dissemination; elaboration of interinstitutional agreements for IPE implementation; and
the development of undergraduate and postgraduate courses that incorporate an
interprofessional approach. The next IPE regional meeting to discuss the progress of the
country&#x02019;s action plans will be held in Brasilia in late 2017.</p><p>Much remains to be done to ensure that health professionals&#x02019; education is focused on the
needs of the health systems and that trained professionals work effectively in health
teams that are articulate and well-versed in people- and community-centered, integrated
care<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. The interest shown by countries of the Region in supporting and encouraging
PAHO/WHO to continue the discussion on IPE could be another step toward building
interprofessional health teams and could thus help improve the effectiveness of health
systems and contribute to the achievement of Universal Access to Health and Universal
Health Coverage.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="confproc"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Pan American Health Organization</collab></person-group><source>Strategy for Universal Access to Health and Universal Health Coverage
