    "Hospital medicine is the fastest growing specialty in the United States. An interesting aspect of the rapid expansion of hospital medicine is the expansion of the field beyond the United States. Although the health care systems, regulations, and cultural norms in these nations differ, there are striking similarities in the profession's development. We performed a literature review to better understand the factors contributing to the growth of hospital medicine internationally. In this article, we describe some of the drivers for expansion of hospital medicine outside the United States and the challenges faced by these groups. We also discuss the role the United States could play in the continued growth of hospital medicine internationally."
