Accordingly, we showed that lymphocytes from AD patients have an increased susceptibility, whereas those from survivors of a skin cancer, an increased resistance to oxidative death induced by hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), compared to healthy controls (HC). We investigated the susceptibility to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced death of lymphocytes in survivors of any type of cancer and in cancer survivors who later developed AD (Ca&#x00026;AD). We also explored the involvement of Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and p53 pathways in the process, since both are involved in the increased susceptibility to death of AD lymphocytes. Lymphocytes from 11 cancer and 13 Ca&#x00026;AD patients, and 12 HC were submitted to increasing concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 20 h. Cell death was determined by flow cytometry, in the presence or absence of PARP-1 inhibition (3-aminobenzamide, 3-ABA), or p53 inhibition (pifithrin-&#x003b1;) or stabilization (Nut-3). PARP-1 and p53 mRNA levels were determined by Real-Time PCR. Lymphocytes from cancer and Ca&#x00026;AD patients showed increased survival compared to HC, without differences between them, opposite to the increased susceptibility to death previously shown in AD. PARP-1 inhibition provided marked protection from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced death in the two groups of patients, significantly greater than in HC. Pharmacological inhibition of p53 increased lymphocyte survival in Ca&#x00026;AD patients, contrary to the effect previously reported in HC and AD. PARP-1 and p53 mRNA levels were elevated in Ca&#x00026;AD lymphocytes compared with controls. In all, these results show that cancer imprints an increased resistance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced death in lymphocytes that persists after AD development, and is dependent on both PARP-1 and p53. p53 inhibition showed a differential role in cancer and Ca&#x00026;AD compared to HC and AD lymphocytes, that could explain the inverse susceptibility to oxidative death in cancer and AD. These results are in agreement with the hypothesis of a common biological mechanism in AD and cancer. The similar cell death susceptibility and cell death pattern observed in cancer and Ca&#x00026;AD lymphocytes suggests that cancer history leaves long term effects on lymphocyte cell death susceptibility.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>AD</kwd><kwd>oxidative death resistance</kwd><kwd>lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>PARP-1</kwd><kwd>p53</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient&#x000ed;fico y Tecnol&#x000f3;gico<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002850</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">1151297</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">1140468</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="38"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="6820"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Our group and others have reported that patients with AD have a lower risk of developing cancer, and inversely, patients with a history of cancer in the past show a lower risk of developing AD. We showed an inverse association between AD and cancer in a memory and aging cohort of around 600 patients and in the Cardiovascular Health Study, a population based sample of 3,000 individuals (Roe et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). This inverse association was later replicated in several other epidemiological studies (Roe et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Driver et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Musicco et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Ou et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; White et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Frain et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In a meta-analysis, Catala et al. found 50% reduced risk of AD in cancer survivors and a 36% lower risk of cancer in AD patients (Catal&#x000e1;-L&#x000f3;pez et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Furthermore, in a recent report, Frain et al. reported a reduced risk of AD in most cancer types in a US national database of 3,499,378 veterans (Frain et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Importantly, this study also showed there was a higher risk of other age-related diseases such as, stroke, osteoarthritis, macular degeneration, and non-AD dementia, indicating that the inverse association was not simply due to ascertain bias, of non-diagnosing a serious condition when the another one is present. The inverse association was also demonstrated for skin cancers only (Roe et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; White et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), basal and squamous cell carcinomas, which represent around 50% of all cancers. Therefore, AD and cancer seem to protect each other from the development of the other pathology, however, there are a few patients having both disorders, a history of a cancer in the past that later develop AD.</p><p>This epidemiological relationship between cancer and dementia rises the interesting possibility that one or more biological mechanisms may link both disorders (Behrens et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Tabar&#x000e9;s-Seisdedos and Rubenstein, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Driver et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). If such a mechanism can be identified, it might lead to better understanding of the pathology of these two disorders, as well as strategies to treatment development. Considering that aging is the greatest risk factor for a majority of chronic diseases, the exploration of the mechanisms associated with age-related chronic diseases might give us clues for common mechanism behind the aging processes. We have proposed that the cellular machinery controlling cell death in response to stress could be deregulated in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders leading to a more prone to death state, and in the opposite way, to a more prone to survival status in cancer (Behrens et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Accordingly, we demonstrated that lymphocytes from AD patients show an increased susceptibility to death by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure, whereas those from skin cancer patients show increased survival, compared with lymphocytes from healthy control donors, without cognitive impairment, or cancer history of similar age and sex (Behrens et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In addition, we showed that in patients with dementia, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> lymphocyte death susceptibility increased in magnitude with the severity of the disease (Ponce et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and is also present in the early stages of the disorder, in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Salech et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>p53 and poly [ADP-ribose]-polymerase-1 (PARP-1) are cell repair pathways that respond to injuries produced by reactive oxygen species triggered by several damages, such as amyloid beta peptide exposure (Martire et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Depending on the extent of the damage, p53 and/or PARP-1 can initiate DNA repair mechanisms or, on the contrary, activate programmed cell death inducing either apoptosis, or a caspase-independent, PARP-1-dependent cell death (Lakin and Jackson, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Jagtap and Szab&#x000f3;, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Green and Kroemer, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>In previous studies, we showed that the susceptibility of lymphocytes to cell death induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in patients with cognitive impairment is dependent on both PARP-1 an p53 activity (Salech et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In AD patients PARP-1 inhibition caused significant protection from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced death, but did not reach control levels, suggesting that other cell death mechanisms are involved. In fact, we found that modulation of p53 in lymphocytes of healthy control subjects induced an increase in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced death, that attained the levels seen in AD. In addition, lymphocytes from AD patients were unaffected by modulation of p53. The lack of effect of p53 modulation together with an increase in p53 mRNA levels in AD lymphocytes suggests that p53 has lost its response to modulation in this condition.</p><p>We here investigated the death of lymphocytes induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in survivors of any type of cancer and in survivors of cancer who later developed AD (Ca&#x00026;AD). In addition, we investigated the role of PARP-1 and p53 on the regulation of the susceptibility to oxidative death in these two groups of patients and compared them with the results previously reported in AD lymphocytes (Salech et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), in order to elucidate the involvement of the cell repair machinery in the inverse susceptibility to oxidative death of lymphocytes from cancer and AD patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 36 individuals: 11 cancer, 13 Ca&#x00026;AD patients and 12 healthy donors were recruited. All participants signed an informed consent that was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital Cl&#x000ed;nico de la Universidad de Chile. Caregivers of patients with severe dementia provided the consent. Three patients from the healthy control and cancer group were analyzed in previous reports (Behrens et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Salech et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), but donated new blood samples. For the diagnosis of AD the guidelines of Alzheimer's Association and the National Institute on Aging (McKhann et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) were followed and dementia severity was rated with the CDR (Morris, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). In addition, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test validated by us in Spanish (Delgado et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) was applied. The maximum score for the MoCA is 30, with lower scores associated with greater cognitive deterioration. Patients in the Ca&#x00026;AD group had variable degrees of cognitive impairment with CDRs ranging from 0.5 to 2 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The types of cancer in the cancer and Ca&#x00026;AD groups are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. The most frequent types of cancer were skin, breast and colon. The time elapsed between the cancer diagnosis and enrolment in the present study was between 3 and 20 years.

As previously reported for skin cancer only patients (Behrens et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), lymphocytes from the cancer group in this study showed increased resistance to cell death induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure, compared with HC lymphocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Lymphocytes from patients suffering from both, AD and cancer (Ca&#x00026;AD) showed a very similar cell death susceptibility as the cancer group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

The increased levels of PARP-1 mRNA in the cancer and Ca&#x00026;AD groups might indicate a protective role of PARP-1 in these cells and thus explain the increased resistance to death in lymphocytes from patients with a history of cancer.

The stabilization of p53 with nutlin had no effect on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced death, neither in cancer nor in Ca&#x00026;AD lymphocytes, similar to that described in patients with AD (Salech et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Effect of p53 modulation on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced death of lymphocytes.

This result is opposite to that reported in AD lymphocytes which showed higher susceptibility to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced death (Salech et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The higher resistance to death observed in lymphocytes from cancer an Ca&#x00026;AD patients confirms our previous study showing an increased resistance in a skin cancer only group of patients (Behrens et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Therefore, a higher resistance to cell death could be a more generalized effect in all cancer types, in agreement with the inverse association demonstrated in epidemiological studies between AD and all types of cancers (Roe et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Musicco et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Ou et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). We also show that the death induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in cancer and Ca&#x00026;AD lymphocytes is modulated by both PARP-1 and p53. These same pathways are involved in the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced death of lymphocytes from HC and AD patients, as we previously showed. However interestingly, the inhibition of p53 in the cancer and Ca&#x00026;AD groups of patients in this study induced and increase in survival, which is opposite to the effect of p53 inhibition in lymphocytes from AD patients and HC subjects in our previous report (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) (Salech et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). These results suggest that a deregulation of the p53 pathway may be involved in the mechanism of the inverse association seen between AD and cancer.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Comparison of lymphocyte survival and the effect of p53 inhibition among the different groups.

Reactive oxygen species generated by oxidative stress due to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, activate the cellular machinery to avoid damage to the DNA and other cellular components. p53 and PARP-1 are both activated upon oxidative stress. When the level of damage is low, p53 and PARP-1 facilitate DNA repair mechanisms and have been called guardians of the genome. However, upon intense damage, they promote cell death. p53 is a transcription factor that upon stress induces either, cell cycle arrest, senescence or apoptosis (Lakin and Jackson, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Green and Kroemer, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). PARP-1 is a nuclear enzyme that participates in DNA repair, but under severe damage, consumes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>), depleting the cell of energy and therefore leading to a caspase-independent cell death (Lakin and Jackson, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Jagtap and Szab&#x000f3;, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). In a neuroblastoma cell line, PARP-1 has an important role in the molecular mechanism of amyloid beta peptide damage, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death by a 60% increase in its activity (Martire et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This PARP-1-dependent, caspase-independent type of cell death has been named parthanatos (Wang et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Fatokun et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Dawson and Dawson, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). We have reported previously that the death of human lymphocytes induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is very markedly protected by PARP-1 inhibition, and is not accompanied by changes in caspase activity, suggesting that it belongs to this type of death (Behrens et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>We here show that PARP-1 has also a preponderant role in the death of lymphocytes induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the cancer and Ca&#x00026;AD groups. In previous reports (Behrens et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) we showed that PARP-1 inhibition had a higher protection in lymphocytes from skin cancer patients compared to those of AD patients, with control lymphocytes showing intermediate values. Here we reproduce these results in lymphocytes from cancer patients including different types of cancer. In addition, we show that Ca&#x00026;AD lymphocytes showed levels of protection very similar to the cancer group. This result together with the higher levels of PARP-1 mRNA expression observed in Ca&#x00026;AD lymphocytes (and also a non-significant increase in cancer lymphocytes), suggests that having had a cancer in the past might leave a trace of higher levels of PARP-1 that protects cells from oxidative death. However, at the protein level, we didn't see clear differences between the groups because of great variability within groups. In addition, it is interesting to remark that we also found an increase in PARP-1 mRNA levels in MCI lymphocytes, but not in AD (Salech et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), in support of the idea of a protective role of PARP-1, since, the increase in mRNA of PARP-1 would be present at initial stages of cognitive deterioration, but decreases as the disease progresses to AD.</p><p>In addition to the important role of PARP-1 in lymphocyte oxidative death, p53 also participates in the death of cancer and Ca&#x00026;AD groups, since inhibition of p53 induced an increase in survival in cancer and Ca&#x00026;AD groups. These results are different from those seen in control lymphocytes where p53 inhibition and also p53 stabilization induced an increase in the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced death, suggesting that p53 is involved in maintaining an equilibrium in the regulation of cell survival (Salech et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The results shown here are also different from those of AD and MCI lymphocytes, where p53 inhibition had no effect on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced death, suggesting that cells of AD and MCI patients have lost their regulation of cell survival by p53. Therefore, a differential role of p53 may explain the inverse susceptibility to oxidative death of lymphocytes from cancer and AD patients. These results are consistent with the concept of a common biological mechanisms involved in cancer and AD pathogenesis. mRNA expression of p53 was higher in the Ca&#x00026;AD group (with a non-significant increase in the cancer group). As with PARP-1 the protein levels of p53 measured with Western blot were very variable within groups which precluded further conclusions.</p><p>The Ca&#x00026;AD group had a higher representation of men than the other groups in which there was a predominance of women (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The explanation for this difference might be related to the small number of patients. However, a higher prevalence of chronic diseases, including cardiac arrhythmia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer, has been reported in male patients with AD that might also explain the higher male/female ratio in the Ca&#x00026;AD group (Gambassi et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Buchanan et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p><p>The idea that different aging related diseases share common biological mechanism is gaining relevance with the development of geroscience, an interdisciplinary field that aims to understand the relationship between aging and age-related diseases under the hypothesis that chronic disease and aging share common molecular mechanisms (Burch et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). There is much evidence from animal models that support this hypothesis, but the evidence from models based in human data is sparse (Kirkland, Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med 2015). An altered adaptation to stress, the regulation of cell senescence, and mitochondrial dysfunction are well-recognized aging hallmarks (L&#x000f3;pez-Ot&#x000ed;n et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Kennedy et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and the p53 pathway participates in the regulation of all of them (L&#x000f3;pez-Ot&#x000ed;n et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Rufini et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Fang et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). So, our results contribute to this field with evidence showing that an aging-related pathway (p53) regulates an important pathological process such as cell death, in two different age-related diseases (AD and cancer), in an experimental set-up based in older humans.</p><p>Patients with Ca&#x00026;AD are a very interesting study group, because as they have a past history of cancer and an actual AD, we expected they would show characteristics more similar to AD patients. However, they showed features more similar to cancer patients, such as a decreased susceptibility to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced death compared with lymphocytes from HC, and a potent protective effect of PARP-1 or p53 pharmacological inhibition. These results are also in agreement with the idea that cancer history might leave long term effects in lymphocytes cell death susceptibility, that may be involved in the AD reduced incidence seen in cancer patients.</p><p>Finally, the good correlation between the different characteristics of the lymphocyte cell death susceptibility showed by our results also adds to the increasing evidence that peripheral tissues show changes in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, which represent a much simple tissue to investigate the mechanisms of disease in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>FS: substantial contributions to the conception and design of the work; acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of data; drafting and revising the work for important intellectual content; final approval of the version to be published; DP: substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of data; drafting the work and revising it critically for important intellectual content; final approval of the version to be published; CS: substantial contribution to design of the work; acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of data; drafting and revising the work; final approval of the version to be published; NR: acquisition and analysis of data for the work; final approval of the version to be published; MH: substantial contributions to the design of the work, analysis, and interpretation of data; final approval of the version to be published; MB: substantial contributions to the conception and design of the work; the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of data; drafting the work and revising it critically for important intellectual content; final approval of the version to be published; agreement to be accountable for all aspects the work.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We Thank Dr. Claudio Hetz and Dr. Corbalan for providing BCL-2 and p53 antibodies, Dr. Benjamin Su&#x000e1;rez for allowing us to use the cell incubation room and B&#x000e1;rbara Bruna and Patricia Ayala for technical help.
