The approach has been developed to support the use of findings from qualitative evidence syntheses in decision-making, including guideline development and policy formulation. GRADE-CERQual (hereafter referred to as CERQual) includes four components for assessing how much confidence to place in findings from reviews of qualitative research (also referred to as qualitative evidence syntheses): (1) methodological limitations, (2) coherence, (3) adequacy of data and (4) relevance. This paper focuses on one of these four components, relevance.</p><p id="Par7">When carrying out a CERQual assessment, we define relevance as the extent to which the body of data from the primary studies supporting a review finding is applicable to the context (including for example the perspective or population, phenomenon of interest, setting) specified in the review question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The relevance component in CERQual is analogous to the indirectness domain used in the GRADE approach for assessing confidence in findings from systematic reviews of effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aim</title><p id="Par8">The aim of this paper, part of a series (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), is to describe what we mean by relevance of data in the context of a qualitative evidence synthesis and to give guidance on how to operationalise this component in the context of a review finding as part of the CERQual approach. This paper should be read in conjunction with the papers describing the other three CERQual components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and the paper describing how to make an overall CERQual assessment of confidence and create a Summary of Qualitative Findings table [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

Since then, we have further refined the current definitions of each component and the principles for application of the overall approach using a number of methods. When developing CERQual&#x02019;s relevance component, we undertook informal searches of the literature, including Google and Google Scholar, for definitions and discussion papers related to the concept of relevance and to related concepts such as internal and external validity. We carried out similar searches for the other three components. We presented an early version of the CERQual approach in 2015 to a group of methodologists, researchers and end users with experience in qualitative research, GRADE or guideline development. We further refined the approach through training workshops, seminars and presentations during which we actively sought, collated and shared feedback; by facilitating discussions of individual CERQual components within relevant organisations; through applying the approach within diverse qualitative evidence syntheses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; and through supporting other teams in using CERQual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As far as possible, we used a consensus approach in these processes. We also gathered feedback from CERQual users through an online feedback form and through short individual discussions. The methods used to develop CERQual are described in more detail in the first paper in this series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Assessing relevance</title><p id="Par10">As described above, relevance in the context of CERQual is defined as the extent to which the body of data from the primary studies supporting a review finding is applicable to the context specified in the review question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Relevance is the CERQual component that is anchored to the context specified in the review question. How the review question and objectives are expressed, how a priori subgroup analyses are specified and how theoretical considerations inform the review design are therefore critical to making an assessment of relevance when applying CERQual.</p><p id="Par11">This paper primarily targets review authors who apply CERQual whilst undertaking their own review. We recognise additional circumstances when it is desirable to apply CERQual retrospectively to a review conducted by others. We envisage two scenarios when applying CERQual retrospectively (i) using the original review question or (ii) adapting the context specified in the original review question to reflect a particular context of interest (for example, an a posteriori identified &#x02018;subgroup&#x02019; population or intervention type). These circumstances will feature in subsequent guidance, following additional methodological development and testing. For the remainder of this paper, we focus primarily on review authors who apply CERQual when undertaking their own review. (See also Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> in paper 2 in this series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] for more information about applying CERQual to a synthesis conducted by others.)</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Description of and rationale for the relevance component</title><p id="Par12">Evidence-informed health policymaking requires &#x0201c;relevant research&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] that relates to the review question, which may be defined from initiation of the review or may emerge iteratively during the review process, and to the type of question that is being asked. The methodological literature similarly refers to the degree of fit of included studies to the structured review question as one type of internal validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Internal validity, a term commonly used by systematic review authors, therefore maps onto the &#x02018;internal relevance&#x02019; of included studies to the review question in a qualitative evidence synthesis.</p><p id="Par13">In most qualitative evidence syntheses, the inclusion criteria for studies closely mirror the review question. Included studies must, by definition, be directly relevant to the review question. In other cases, the body of data from the primary studies may not be completely relevant because of differences between these data and the context of the review question, for instance differences in the focus of the study question, perspective or population, the phenomenon of interest or intervention, the setting or the timeframe. In some cases, the body of data from the included primary studies only partially address the context specified by the review question. This occurs if the body of data from the included studies covers only a subgroup of the population or a subtype of the intervention. In other cases, relevant studies are missing entirely. Under these circumstances, review authors sometimes extend the scope of eligible studies to include studies linked to the review question conceptually or by analogy.</p><p id="Par14">CERQual focuses on the assessment of the <italic>internal</italic> relevance of the body of evidence from included studies contributing to a review finding, as mapped against the context of the review question. This assessment of relevance is not intended to make externally referent claims regarding the transferability, generalisability or applicability (terms that we take to mean the same) of a review finding. Wider <italic>external</italic> relevance (a concept that maps onto external validity&#x02013;&#x02013;a term also commonly used by review authors conducting quantitative systematic reviews of the effectiveness of interventions) of a review finding is addressed in part by the overall CERQual assessment. This overall assessment, based on judgements for all four CERQual components, seeks to establish the extent to which a synthesis finding is a reasonable representation of the phenomenon of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. An overall CERQual assessment communicates the extent to which the synthesis finding is likely to be substantially different from the phenomenon of interest, as defined in the review question. For completeness, an explanation of external relevance can be found in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>.</p><p id="Par15">When assessing relevance in the context of CERQual, our aim is <italic>not</italic> to judge whether some absolute standard of relevance has been <italic>achieved</italic>, but to judge whether there are <italic>grounds for concern</italic> regarding relevance. Having identified any such concerns, we must consider whether these are sufficiently serious to lower our confidence in the review finding. We are likely to have concerns about relevance when the context of the included studies does not adequately reflect the context determined by the review question.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Guidance on how to assess relevance of data in the context of a review finding (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>)</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Step 1: clarify the review question and context</title><p id="Par16">When designing any review and developing the protocol, you should consider and decide which contextual factors are important for the review question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

Alternatively, a decision on likely factors may be informed by an existing review in a similar topic area. Incorporating insights from external frameworks, theories or comparable reviews at the design stage may help with a later assessment of relevance. For example, a specific theoretical perspective (such as a behavioural theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]) or lens (such as an equity lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]) may be adopted to help define and refine the review question and important contextual factors. Identification, selection and application of an appropriate theory are critical to this process, and Cochrane Guidance is available for review authors to aid in selecting social theories in reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Depending on the methodology selected, you may specify the review question(s) a priori in the protocol or may develop question(s) iteratively as part of the review process, with the final question(s) being documented later. Information about the context of the review question may appear in several sections of the review protocol, including the structured review question, inclusion/exclusion criteria and any parameters set for the search and retrieval of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The review&#x02019;s inclusion and exclusion criteria are thus an important additional source of information when assessing relevance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Typically, these criteria include the geographical and temporal setting and the characteristics of the population, such as gender, ethnicity, religion and other demographic and cultural factors&#x02013;&#x02013;the micro-context for the review (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par19">If the review explores how an intervention is implemented, then the review&#x02019;s inclusion and exclusion criteria are also likely to include the characteristics of the intervention and of those administering the intervention, and possibly also the organisational characteristics within which the intervention is delivered (the meso-context). For other review questions, particularly those related to policy, the political and legislative background context (the macro-context) are equally, if not more, important.</p><p id="Par20">You may also augment the core review question, for instance by pre-specifying specific subgroups of the population or setting (for instance, young men or rural health facilities) that you will consider separately in the analysis. Pre-specification of subgroup analyses offers review authors the opportunity to apply CERQual to subgroup level findings. However, we recognise that review authors may only uncover meaningful groupings as they conduct the review itself.</p><p id="Par21">If you are applying CERQual to someone else&#x02019;s review and the original question and context remain unchanged, then step 1 would apply in the same way. At present, we have no empirical base for guidance on applying CERQual to someone else&#x02019;s review when aspects of the original context of the review question have been changed to reflect a new context. We have yet to undertake the methodological development and testing for this specific application of CERQual.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Step 2: decide on the appropriateness and implications of the study inclusion strategy</title><p id="Par22">As a review author, you need to make an informed judgement on how and why you selected primary studies in relation to your review question. In a qualitative evidence synthesis, you can choose different strategies when identifying and selecting studies to synthesise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. For some syntheses, you may include all eligible primary studies, for example, when the qualitative synthesis is coterminous with an effectiveness review. For exploratory or interpretive syntheses, only a sample of the eligible studies may be included. When subsequently assessing relevance, you should reflect on how the sample was located and on the underpinning principles that determined its selection. For example, was the sample selected to explain the attitudes or behaviours of a particular group or to demonstrate the applicability of a theory across groups? In making decisions on how to select the sample of included studies, you may trade-off such factors as the methodological strengths and limitations of available studies (see paper 3 in this series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]), the relevance of the evidence to the review question and, for instance, the geographical coverage of studies in relation to the review question. For example, if the question is global, review authors may purposively select studies from diverse settings. Conducting an initial knowledge map of potential studies to identify important contextual factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], together with other important elements, may help to design a sampling frame to inform decisions about studies for potential inclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Pragmatically, the sampling strategy seeks to optimise the trade-off between the number of available studies that meets the inclusion criteria versus the time available to synthesise studies. A key consideration relates to whether or not a review is required to inform an imminent decision. Where this is the case, the decision maker needs to draw upon the most relevant available evidence and studies may be sampled on that basis. A further consideration is where dissemination bias might limit the identification of relevant evidence to address the question for a specific context. Recent work outlines the conceptual basis for the effects of dissemination bias in qualitative research and its likely extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], while the final paper in this series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] addresses how dissemination bias in qualitative research might impact upon a CERQual assessment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Step 3: gather information about relevance in the included studies</title><p id="Par24">Next, you need to gather information from included primary studies to help you to identify similarities between the context of the studies supporting each review finding and the context specified in the review question. Information about context in the primary studies that maps against the context of interest as specified in the review protocol may be reported throughout the primary study. This step is therefore a &#x02018;search, find and subsequently extract&#x02019; exercise. As far as possible, you should ensure that this information is gathered as part of the screening or subsequent data extraction process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Step 4: assess the body of data that contributes to each review finding and decide whether you have concerns about relevance</title><p id="Par25">An assessment of relevance is best facilitated by access to subject-specific knowledge either amongst the review authors or from an expert advisory group. To assess the relevance of the data, you need to identify similarities and differences between the context of the studies supporting each review finding and the context specified in the review question. You should assess relevance for each review finding individually and not for the review as a whole.

In other words, one or more aspects of context are substituted with another in these studies. For example<bold>,</bold> if a synthesis is looking at factors affecting the implementation of public health campaigns for bird flu but finds no, or very little, evidence of direct relevance to bird flu, they may choose to include indirect evidence from studies of swine flu campaigns to address the original synthesis question. This use of indirect evidence is based on the assumption that there are likely to be sufficient common factors between the implementation of the respective public health campaigns. In contrast, other contextual factors such as animal versus bird welfare and containment in a flu epidemic are likely to be very different. Review authors therefore need to be cautious when interpreting indirect evidence where some contextual factors are similar and others are not in order to ensure that the use of indirect evidence is not misleading.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par28">(Some of) the underlying data are of <italic>partial relevance</italic>: this is assigned where a part of the context of the larger review question (e.g. a population subgroup) is addressed directly by a review finding but where evidence is lacking for the complete context specified in the review question. For example, a review question seeks to determine Muslim women&#x02019;s experiences of divorce and child custody. A finding that only includes evidence from Jordanian Muslem women may be assessed as &#x0201c;partially relevant&#x0201d; for Muslim women in general. In some circumstances, it may be more appropriate and meaningful to rephrase a finding to incorporate the aspects of context that indicate that the finding is for a particular &#x02018;subgroup&#x02019; in relation to context. Using the same example, the evidence would be reassessed as &#x0201c;directly relevant&#x0201d; for a finding relating to Jordanian Muslim women specifically when this group was pre-specified as a subgroup of interest. Decisions on the level of granularity used when framing the findings depends upon the purpose and intended audience for your specific review.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par29">It is unclear whether the underlying data is relevant (<italic>unclear relevance</italic>): this assessment should be reserved for situations where you have identified, typically a priori, important factors that influence the interpretation of review findings but where you are unable to identify those factors from included studies. For example, you have reason to believe that different age groups respond differently to health appointment reminders sent via mobile phone.

You are not, however, seeking a perfect fit between the included studies and the context of the review question. As with the other CERQual components, the emphasis is on characteristics that trigger significant concerns (see paper 2 in this series on making an overall CERQual assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]). In many cases, you will assess the relevance of review findings that are supported by studies that are not derived from the exact setting for which the decision is intended. For example, even if one or more individual studies derive from the same country as the decision-making context, you cannot consider these studies to be fully representative of that country. Where multiple studies exist, derived directly from the decision-making context, these studies may represent different time periods within different political and economic settings. In general, we would have no concerns regarding relevance for a review finding where we judge there to be no important differences between the context of the data contributing to the review finding and the context specified in the review question.</p><p id="Par32">Our confidence in a review finding may, however, be reduced where the relation between the contexts of the primary studies and that specified in the review question is not apparent. For example, there may be differences in the perspective or population, the phenomenon of interest or intervention, the context or the timeframe. In addition, in a review where studies with a direct relation are not found, you may include studies that imperfectly represent aspects of the context. For example, you may use studies conducted with immediately pre- or post-adolescents to inform a review question relating to adolescents if you have been unable to find any studies of the adolescents themselves.</p><p id="Par33">The relevance of a review finding is not related to the number of primary studies contributing data to that finding. For instance, where a finding is based on data from a single study that matches the contextual factors identified in the review question, you would not have concerns about relevance. In contrast, you may have concerns about relevance for a review finding derived from multiple studies if the contexts of those studies do not match the context of the review question.

Moderate concerns may lead us to consider lowering our confidence, as part of our final assessment of all four CERQual components. Where you have concerns about relevance, you should describe these concerns in the CERQual Evidence Profile in sufficient detail to allow users of the review findings to understand the reasons for the assessments made (for more information, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Implications when concerns about relevance are identified</title><p id="Par40">Concerns about relevance may not only impact on our confidence in a review finding but also may point to ways of improving future research.

For example, in the absence of relevant evidence on what works concerning public health risk communication in swine flu, you could consider using indirect evidence from risk communication in bird flu. You need to also consider whether the use of indirect evidence will impact on your assessment of the other CERQual components.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par42">Assessing the relevance component requires that you consider potentially important contextual factors at an early stage in the review process. Concerns about relevance impact on assessments of confidence in review findings and are therefore integral to the CERQual approach.
