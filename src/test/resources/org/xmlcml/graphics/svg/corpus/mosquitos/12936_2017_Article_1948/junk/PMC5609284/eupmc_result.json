    "Mining activities have been carried out for thousands of years and nowadays have an enormous worldwide use to obtain important metals of industrial use. These include copper, iron, gold and several others. Although modern mining companies have sustainable mining programs that include tailings management and external verifications, it is recognized that these industrial activities are responsible for a significant damage to the environment. Specially, technologies such as smelting and roasting generate very toxic emissions, including solid particles in the air, very large tailings and contribute to generate acid mine drainage (AMD) that affects humans health and all kinds of living plants, animals and microorganisms. Consequently, due to environmental restrictions, these methods are being replaced in many countries by less contaminating processes. On the other hand, the microbial solubilization of metals by bioleaching or biomining is successfully used in industrial operations, to extract several metals such as copper, gold and uranium."
