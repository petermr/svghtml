patients with testicular cancer before cryopreservation and after thawing,
to evaluate the consequences of this technique on sperm quality in patients
with testicular cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Five hundred eighty-nine samples from 543 patients with testicular cancer
were cryopreserved between 1995 and 2015, one aliquot per patient was used
for a thawing test to assess the impact of cryopreservation on sperm
motility; semen analysis was performed before cryo preservation and after

worldwide, and its incidence continues to increase in most Caucasian populations,
where it is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in young patients (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">Shanmugalingham <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>).
<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">Martinez <italic>et al</italic>. (2015)</xref>
reported the incidence in Chile to be 7.9/100.000 males (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">Martinez <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). This cancer affects
young adults, with a median age of 32.45 years, and its mortality is only
1.1/100.000 males (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">Martinez <italic>et al</italic>.,
2015</xref>), which means that the vast majority of patients with testicular
cancer treated will be willing to father a child after the treatment. Testicular
tumors impair fertility and, moreover, cancer treatment can adversely affect
spermatogenesis because of its effect on the testis (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">Tournaye <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Therefore, sperm
cryopreservation should be considered as a real option for fertility preservation in
males with testicular cancer before receiving any treatment (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">Garcia <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Fertility after testicular cancer treatment is variable and depends on pretreatment
semen characteristics, the effect of cryopreservation on the spermatozoa and the
consequences of the type of treatment on spermatogenesis (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">Garcia <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Sperm banking before
cancer treatment enables the subsequent use of semen for Medically Assisted
Reproduction (MAR) (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">Zegers-Hochschild <italic>et
al</italic>., 2009</xref>), either Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) or
Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI), to achieve pregnancy when men are not able
to spontaneously impregnate their female partners. However, it has been reported
that only 10-15% of males use their cryopreserved samples after cancer treatment
(<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">van Casteren <italic>et al</italic>.,
2008</xref>).</p><p>The main objective of this study was to assess semen characteristics of patients with
testicular cancer at the time of cryopreservation, before their treatment, and after
thawing, to assess the consequences of this technique on sperm quality. A secondary
objective was to evaluate the rate of use of cryopreserved sperm after cancer
treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Five hundred and forty-three patients with testicular cancer were referred from the
National Cancer Corporation to the Andrology Laboratory at Cl&#x000ed;nica Las
Condes, Santiago-Chile, for sperm cryopreservation, between 1995 and 2015. After
counselling, a consent form, approved by the institutional Research Ethics Committee
for sperm cryopreservation, was signed by all men. All semen samples were obtained
before surgery and other treatments for testicular cancer and no posterior
distinction was made between patients having seminoma and non-seminoma tumors. A
total of 589 semen samples were obtained by masturbation into a sterile container
and allowed to liquefy for 30 minutes. Semen analysis was performed using
standardized procedures throughout the study period, and interpretation of results
was carried out using the 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) Laboratory Manual
criteria (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Semen volume, sperm count and progressive motility were assessed and registered
before cryopreservation. Hypospermia (&#x0003c; 1.5 mL), oligozoospermia (&#x0003c; 15
million/mL) and astenozoospermia (&#x0003c; 32% spermatozoa with progressive motility)
were defined based on the fifth percentile cut-off, according to WHO definitions
(<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2010</xref>). Prewashed total motile sperm
count (TMSC) was obtained per sample, by multiplying semen volume of the ejaculate
by the sperm concentration and the ratio of progressive motile sperm, divided by 100
(<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton <italic>et al</italic>.,
2015</xref>).</p><p>Semen samples were cryopreserved in doses of 0.5 to 1 mL aliquots in cryogenic tubes
(Nalgene, Fisher Scientific<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, USA) with Test-Yolk Buffer
(TYB<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Irvine Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. TYB<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> contains 20% egg yolk, 12% glycerol and
10&#x000b5;g/mL gentamicin sulfate. One dose per patient was used for a thawing test
to assess the impact of cryopreservation on sperm motility. Progressive motility was
assessed and registered after thawing and TMSC before and after the procedure was
also calculated.</p><p>The number of men using their frozen semen for reproductive purposes was recorded as
well as the number of patients discarding their samples, either by themselves or as
part of a standard procedure after death. No further follow up of patients
undergoing fertility treatments could be performed.</p><p>Results were described by the Mean &#x000b1; Standard Deviation for parametric data
and by the Median and ranges for non-parametric data. Statistical analysis for
differences before cryopreservation and after thawing was performed by the Student
t-test for parametric data and by the Mann-Whitney-u test for non-parametric data. A
<italic>p</italic>-value lower than 0.01 was considered statistically
significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean age of the patients was 26.9 &#x000b1; 6.4 years old and the mean number of
cryopreserved doses per patient was 4.9 &#x000b1; 2.5. Two hundred sixty-one fresh
native samples (44.3%) were normal prior to cryopreservation: sperm volume &#x02265;
1.5 mL, sperm count &#x02265; 15 million/mL and sperm progressive motility &#x02265;
32%. The mean number of years of the samples at the sperm bank was 6.6 &#x000b1;
4.4.</p><p>The mean semen volume was 2.2 &#x000b1; 1.1 mL. The semen volume was &#x02265; 1.5 mL
in 420 samples (71.3%) and &#x0003c; 1,5 mL in 169 samples (hypospermia = 28.7%).</p><p>The median sperm concentration was 18 million/mL (0 &#x02013; 219.5). Twenty-two patients
(4.1%) had azoospermia and 69 patients (12.7%) had severe oligozoospermia, defined
as &#x02264; 1 million sperm/mL in native semen. Among samples with spermatozoa, 383
had &#x02265; 15 million sperm/mL (65%) and 206 had &#x0003c; 15 million/mL
(oligozoospermia = 35%). The median total sperm count was 31.3 (0 - 620.2) million.
It was &#x02265; 39 million in 263 samples (44.7%) and &#x0003c; 39 million in 326 samples
(55.3%).</p><p>The sperm progressive motility in fresh semen was &#x02265; 32% in 405 samples (68.8%)
and &#x0003c; 32 in 184 samples (astenozoospermia = 31.2%). Sperm progressive motility
after the thawing test was &#x02265; 32% in 38.2% of the samples and &#x0003c; 32 in 61.8%
of the samples. In six patients no motile sperm was found before cryopreservation
and 12 more males did not have motile sperm after the thawing test, yielding a total
of 18 patients without motile sperm (3.3%). As shown on <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">table 1</xref>, the mean sperm progressive motility before
cryopreservation and after thawing was 40.6 &#x000b1; 19.8 and 25.7 &#x000b1; 17.2,
respectively (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.00001, 95% CI 12.82-16.98), which means a

testicular cancer affects young males (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">Auger
<italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">Rives
<italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). This issue and the potential effects
of gonadotoxic treatments on semen quality reaffirm how relevant it is to address
fertility preservation in this group of patients before cancer treatment.</p><p>An impairment in semen quality has been reported in patients with testicular cancer
by all large series concerning male fertility preservation before oncology treatment
(<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">Auger <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>;
<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">Rives <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).
Indeed, in a recently published study, <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">Auger
<italic>et al</italic>. (2016)</xref> reported only 50.9 % of men with
testicular cancer presenting normozoospermia, using WHO 2010 thresholds. In our
study, we had 8.7% of hypospermia, 35% of oligozoospermia and 31.2% of
asthenozoospermia. Normozoospermia was observed in 44.3% of samples.</p><p>Hypospermia has also been reported by <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">Auger <italic>et
al</italic>. (2016)</xref> and it can be explained because semen volume
depends on mechanisms that are influenced by the level of excitement during semen
collection and the psychological condition of cancer patients can influence it.</p><p>The median sperm concentration in this study was 18 million/mL with a range from 0 to
219,5, being lower than the median of 30, but the range wider than 16-55 reported by
<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">Ragni <italic>et al</italic>. (2003)</xref>
although, similar to a median of 19.6 million/mL reported by <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">Auger <italic>et al</italic>. (2016)</xref>. On the other hand, the
median number of spermatozoa in the ejaculate in our study was 31.3 million, almost
half the median value reported by <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">Auger <italic>et
al</italic>. (2016)</xref>. Indeed, it has been reported that patients with
testicular cancer have the lowest sperm concentrations of all oncology categories
needing cryopreservation prior to cancer treatment (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">Bahadur <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">Degl'Innocenti <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Azoospermia and severe
oligozoospermia was found in 4.1% and 12.7% of patients, respectively, which is
similar to the values of 6.6% and 15% reported by <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">Rives <italic>et al</italic>. (2012)</xref>, but lower than the 15.3%
azoospermia reported by <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">Ragni <italic>et
al</italic>. (2003)</xref>.</p><p>The mean progressive motility was 44.64%, which is similar to the 43% reported by
<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">Auger <italic>et al</italic>. (2016)</xref> among
2315 samples, but higher than the 35.6% reported by <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">Rives <italic>et al</italic>. (2012)</xref> within 320 preorchiectomy
samples.</p><p>It has been reported that TMSC is the best way to assess sperm quality (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">Borges, 2016</xref>). TMSC before cryopreservation was
&#x02265; 5 million in 67.3% of the samples in this study, in contrast with the 59.1%
reported by <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">Hotaling <italic>et al</italic>.
(2013)</xref>. Moreover, 40.8% of the samples in our study showed TMSC &#x0003e; 20
million before cryopreservation, which is considered a normal value, with a good
prognosis for achieving spontaneous pregnancy (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The consequences of cryopreservation on sperm quality are well known. Indeed,
spermatozoa can be damaged by the freezing-thawing procedures and sperm motility is
the most affected parameter (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">Degl'Innocenti
<italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Comparison of progressive motility
before cryopreservation and after thawing showed a significant reduction. As shown
on <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">table 1</xref>, we found a 37% reduction in
progressive motility after thawing, which is like the 30% reported by <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">Hotaling <italic>et al</italic>. (2013)</xref>.
However, when the same analysis was made with the TMSC, we found a 32% reduction, in
contrast to the 80% reduction reported by <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">Hotaling
<italic>et al</italic>. (2013)</xref>. This is probably due to a bias in the
analysis of the data from the latter study, in which TMSC was expressed as means,
not having a normal distribution, and parametric instead of non-parametric tests
were used to assess differences between both groups. Indeed, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">Hallak <italic>et al</italic>. (1999)</xref> demonstrated that the
behavior of sperm from patients with testicular cancer is the same as that from
donors, which means that the reduction of TMSC is proportional to the previous
motility in both groups. <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">Degl'Innocenti <italic>et
al</italic>. (2013)</xref> reported that cryopreserved semen samples with
basal number and progressive motility fell below the threshold defined by the WHO
(2010), which showed the lowest TMSC after thawing with a bad prognosis. However,
only 35% and 31.2% of the samples in this study had oligozoospermia and
asthenozoospermia before freezing, respectively. Therefore, the prognosis of
cryopreserved sperm in most of the patients with testicular cancer in our study must
be considered as good. A recent systematic review reported that 50% of patients that
use their cryopreserved samples after cancer treatment achieve pregnancy (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">Ferrari <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It has been reported that TMSC has an accurate prognosis for achieving pregnancy
after cryopreservation (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">Hotaling <italic>et
al</italic>., 2013</xref>). In our study 67.3% of cryopreserved semen
samples had a TMSC &#x02265; 5 million after thawing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>), which has been previously stablished as the threshold for
performing successful IUI (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">Ombelet <italic>et
al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, if this procedure is not
effective, or if TMSC is &#x0003c; 5 million, almost any cryopreserved semen sample, even
when it contains only few motile sperm, could be used for a subsequent infertility
treatment with ICSI, having similar reproductive outcomes if compared with the
procedure performed with fresh sperm (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">Borges
<italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Only patients without motile sperm
would have lower chances to succeed with ICSI (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">Nagy
<italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>), and this was found in only 18 of the
patients included in this study (3.3%), who were properly counselled.</p><p>The low number of patients using their cryopreserved sperm for reproductive purposes
in this study (2.2%) could be explained because some males recover spermatogenesis
and do not need the cryopreserved sperm to impregnate their female partners and,
sadly, because other patients succumb to the cancer, which happened only in 3 cases.
The use rate in this study was lower than the mean percentage of 7% and 8%, reported
for all male cancer patients by <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">van Casteren
<italic>et al</italic>. (2008)</xref> and <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">Ferrari <italic>et al</italic>. (2016)</xref>. This issue could be explained
because the odds ratio for using frozen sperm in other malignancies compared with
testicular cancer is 2.2 (95% CI = 1.1-4.7). The use rate previously reported for
patients with testicular cancer is 3.2% (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">Ragni
<italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), however, the use rate in our study is
even lower. This can be explained by the limited access to MAR in Chile (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">Mackenna &#x00026; Zegers-Hochschild, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Unfortunately, as in other reports, the causes of the low use and discard rates (2.2%
and 2.2%) cannot be exactly known in our study, because of the loss of follow up.
For that reason, it cannot be concluded that the remaining patients, that still have
cryopreserved samples, will need their frozen sperm in the future, although, we can
assume that most of them could need it because the mean age of the patients at the
time of cryopreservation was only 26.9 years old and the mean number of years of
cryopreservation is 6.6 years.</p><p>Due to the low use and discard rates, some studies have addressed the
cost-effectiveness of sperm banking in male cancer patients, however, if we consider
the potential use rate, no conclusions can be obtained yet and more studies, with an
accurate follow up, should be performed in the future. In the meantime, sperm
cryopreservation for fertility preservation should to be offered to all adult men
and post pubertal boys with testicular cancer, before cancer treatment onset,
because it is simple, it does not mean a delay in the oncology treatment and is an
effective way for fertility preservation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title> REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Auger</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Sermondade</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Eustache</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Semen quality of 4480 young cancer and systemic disease patents:
