    "Greater omentum leiomyosarcomas are rare tumors with only a few cases reported in literature.We report the case of a 68-year-old man who consulted complaining of diffuse abdominal pain without a palpable mass at physical examination. Imaging studies revealed a solid-cystic lesion in the right lower quadrant. Surgical resection was performed and the tumor was diagnosed as a leiomyoscarcoma by histological and immunohistochemical examinations.Surgical resection of all lesions seems to be a reasonable therapeutic approach if resection is feasible. Chemotherapy may be used in selected cases.More cases are needed to define the best treatment approach of this disease."
