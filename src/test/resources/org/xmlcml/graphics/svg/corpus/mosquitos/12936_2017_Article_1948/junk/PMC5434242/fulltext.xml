Introduction</title><p>Oxidative stress has been implied in the etiology of numerous diseases as well as in the ageing process [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The balance established in terms of the relative amounts of antioxidants and reactive species (reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and electrophilic molecules) plays a pivotal role in the cellular integrity and functionality [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Antioxidants and reactive species can have an exogenous or endogenous origin, dietary intake being the most important source of exogenous antioxidants [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It has been suggested that the intake of dietary antioxidants is inversely associated with the development of chronic diseases, which currently constitute the main cause of mortality worldwide [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In fact, dietary interventions in humans, as well as in vitro studies, have shown evidence regarding the beneficial effects on the health related to the consumption of berries [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These effects have been mainly attributed to their content of polyphenols, which can protect biological systems against the damage induced by numerous agents, including free radicals [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Cellular protection mediated by polyphenols against free radical-induced damage can be exerted by different mechanisms, including scavenging of free radicals by direct reactions, metal ion complexation with a consequent inhibition of the free radicals generated through Fenton-type reactions, and activation of the intracellular signaling cascades that result in activation of detoxifying enzymes or repression of pro-oxidant proteins [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, during the last years, it has been suggested that, under physiological conditions and in vivo, the main protective mechanism associated with polyphenols arising from dietary sources involves activation of transcription factors that regulate the expression and activity of antioxidant and detoxifying systems in cells [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This concept agrees with the relative low bioavailability of polyphenols (implying very low systemic concentrations) and would explain the lack of correlation between their in vitro antioxidant capacity and their protective effects on cellular cultures (which imply cellular responses) [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, human gastric epithelial cells are constantly exposed to an oxidative environment produced by the intake of reactive species (generated during thermal processing of foods) as well as by the oxidative reactions that take place during the processes associated with food digestion [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These cells are also exposed to polyphenols arising from foods, which have not been previously metabolized by the liver or colonic microflora [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this sense, gastric epithelial cells constitute a unique model in which different mechanisms of cytoprotection mediated by polyphenols could be active. The human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line (AGS) consists of mucus-secreting epithelial cells presenting several characteristics of normal gastric epithelial cells and a good power of differentiation [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For this reason, they have been widely used to evaluate the antioxidant activity of several lentil cultivars [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In fact, we have recently reported that polyphenolic-enriched extracts (PEEs) from Chilean native berries, including <italic>Rubus geoides</italic> and <italic>Ribes magellanicum</italic> (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/9808520">https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/9808520</ext-link>), present a significant cytoprotective activity against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and methylglyoxal-induced damage of AGS cells [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The Chilean native berries selected for this study are wild relatives of the widely cultivated and consumed strawberries, raspberries, and currants. The PEEs of these species have also shown a high scavenging capacity of stable free radicals such as DPPH and ABTS [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, evidence aiming to elucidate the main mechanisms involved in the protection of gastric human cells mediated by polyphenols against the damage inflicted by free radicals is lacking.</p><p>It has been reported that numerous polyphenols are able to activate transcription factors including the nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45 (Nrf2) [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which is involved in the control of the expression of detoxifying enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and glyoxalase I [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], inducing protective effects against oxidative stress [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Cellular activation of Nrf2 and the subsequent expression of detoxifying enzymes have shown to occur in a period of hours, and consequently, most responses associated to intracellular antioxidant response activation involves 16&#x02013;24 hours of incubations [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Such time frame contrasts with the kinetic of reactions between free radicals and polyphenols which typically involves rate constants in the range of 10<sup>9</sup>&#x02009;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (towards hydroxyl radicals) [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] to 10<sup>3</sup>&#x02009;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (towards superoxide radical anion) [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>To get more insights regarding the protection afforded by polyphenols from the South American relatives of commercial berries on AGS cells exposed to a free radical source, in the present work, we have addressed studies aimed to assess the cytoprotective mechanisms mediated by the polyphenols contained in the Chilean native raspberry <italic>Rubus geoides</italic>, the native currant <italic>Ribes magellanicum</italic>, and the Chilean strawberry <italic>Fragaria chiloensis</italic> ssp. <italic>chiloensis</italic> f<italic>. chiloensis</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Results</title><p>The ability of polyphenols from Chilean native berries to protect AGS cells against free radical-induced damage was assessed using two different approaches, namely, activation of intracellular antioxidant mechanisms and direct free radical scavenging. The former was assessed by preincubating AGS cells with PPEs during 16 hours and subsequently (after washing cycles) exposing the cells to a challenge by free radical source. In the case of the studies about the free radical scavenging and/or metal-chelating activity of PPEs, AGS cells were simultaneously incubated with each PEE and the free radical sources (coincubation). The protective effects were evaluated using two different sources of free radicals: AAPH and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/CuSO<sub>4</sub> (Fenton-type reaction).</p><p>In the absence of a free radical source, viability of AGS cells was not affected by pre- or coincubations with the different PPEs (15&#x02013;125&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL) (data not shown). But, in the absence of PPEs, when AGS cells were exposed to different doses of free radicals generated by thermal decomposition of AAPH, cell viability showed an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 168&#x02009;mM. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1</xref> shows the cellular viability for AGS cells challenged with AAPH (168&#x02009;mM) and the protective effects of coincubations and preincubations with quercetin (positive control) or PEEs from the Chilean native berries <italic>R. geoides</italic>, <italic>R. magellanicum</italic>, and <italic>F. chiloensis</italic>. The addition of different concentrations of all the extracts (co- and preincubated) to AGS cell cultures induced a statistically significant cytoprotection (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) against the challenge with AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(a)</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(b)</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(c)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(d)</xref>). The Chilean strawberry <italic>Fragaria chiloensis</italic> was the most efficient species against free radical damage induced by AAPH, considering that its cytoprotective activity was exerted at lower concentrations of the PEEs (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(c)</xref>).</p><p>Figure S2 shows the effect of different concentrations of Cu<sup>2+</sup> (added as CuSO<sub>4</sub>) in cell viability in the presence and absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (1.5&#x02009;mM). It was found that, in the absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, Cu<sup>2+</sup> at 410&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M did not affect the cell viability. However, in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, cell viability decreased to 54.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.6% (Figure S2). On the other hand, 1.5&#x02009;mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (in the absence of Cu<sup>2+</sup>) decreased cell viability by 14.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4% (data not shown). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2</xref> shows that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;+&#x02009;Cu<sup>2+</sup> induce a significant decrease in the cell viability compared to the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> controls (in the absence of Cu<sup>2+</sup>). Therefore, cytotoxic effects induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;+&#x02009;Cu<sup>2+</sup> can be attributed not only to free radicals but also in less degree to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(a)</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(b)</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(c)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(d)</xref> show the protective effects of co- and preincubations with PEEs from <italic>R. geoides</italic>, <italic>R. magellanicum</italic>, and <italic>F. chiloensis</italic> against the damage induced by free radicals generated from the redox couple H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;+&#x02009;Cu<sup>2+</sup>. The positive control quercetin induced significant cytoprotection in the coincubation model, but not in the preincubation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The protective effect of all the PEEs against the damage induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;+&#x02009;Cu<sup>2+</sup> was more efficient in the preincubation model than in the coincubation model. In the <italic>F. chiloensis</italic>, PEE presented a significant protection in the model of coincubation. To determine the prevalence of the cytoprotective mechanisms, the area under the curve was calculated using the cell viability plots against the different concentrations of the PEEs. The area under the curve was calculated by normalizing the ratio of the cell viability over cytotoxicity induced by the stressor agent. We defined the coefficient <italic>C</italic><sub>I-S</sub> (intracellular-scavenging) as the area under the curve of the protective effects induced by intracellular antioxidant mechanisms over the area under the curve of protective effects induced by extracellular scavenging. Therefore, when <italic>C</italic><sub>I-S</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, cytoprotective effects of intracellular antioxidant mechanisms will be the same as that of direct scavenging; when <italic>C</italic><sub>I-S</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;1, cytoprotective effects of scavenging will prevail over those exerted by intracellular activation; and when <italic>C</italic><sub>I-S</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;1, cytoprotective effects of intracellular activation will prevail over those exerted by a direct scavenging of free radicals (or chelating effect on Cu<sup>2+</sup>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3</xref> shows the ratio <italic>C</italic><sub>I-S</sub> obtained by the analysis of the protection of the different PEEs against damage mediated by AAPH and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;+&#x02009;Cu<sup>2+</sup>. It can be observed that for hydroxyl radicals the prevalent cytoprotective mechanism was the intracellular activation of antioxidant responses. This fact was also observed when peroxyl radicals were used as the stressor agent, except with the native currant <italic>R. magellanicum</italic>. In this case, the prevalent mechanism was the free radical scavenging.</p><p>To verify the differences in both cytoprotective mechanisms induced by pre- and coincubations, the enzymatic activities of Nrf2-regulated enzymes were determined for both models with the PEEs without free radical challenge. Glutathione S-transferases and glyoxalase I activities were quantified after 30 minutes of incubation (coincubation model) or after 16 hours of incubation (preincubation model) in AGS cells. The concentrations were chosen considering (1) the most effective ones for the protection against peroxyl radicals and (2) those concentrations that presented statistically significant protection with both incubation models. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4(a)</xref> shows that <italic>R. geoides</italic> (Las Raices and Lago Blanco samples) did not present significant differences with the control, whereas <italic>F. chiloensis</italic> and <italic>R. magellanicum</italic> presented a decrease of 25.2% and 34.5%, respectively, in the activities of glutathione S-transferases after coincubation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4(c)</xref> shows that coincubation with <italic>R. magellanicum</italic> and <italic>R. geoides</italic> (Las Raices and Lago Blanco) decreases significantly the activity of glyoxalase I by 38.2, 15.8, and 21.9%, respectively.

Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(c)</xref> show that preincubation of AGS cells with all PEEs elicits a significant increase in the activity of the enzymes glutathione S-transferase and glyoxalase I compared with the control.</p><p>With the aim to determine the effectiveness of each PEEs in the free radical scavenging process, in vitro assays were performed by means of the ORAC methods, using fluorescein and pyrogallol red as the target molecules. ORAC fluorescein (ORAC-FL) provides information about the stoichiometry of the reaction between the free radicals produced by AAPH thermal decomposition, and ORAC red pyrogallol (ORAC-PGR) indicates the reactivity of a sample towards such free radicals. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1"> Table 1</xref> depicts that the order of the antioxidant capacity of all the PEEs was the same in both methods, however, showing higher differences in the PGR-based methodology.

Representative blots of CML under the different treatments described before are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.

Discussion</title><p>It has been established that one of the main sites of the biological action of polyphenols is the stomach [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. For instance, polyphenols from coffee and red wine can exert their antioxidant effects at the stomach cavity during postprandial processes decreasing the levels of plasmatic malondialdehyde [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. On the other hand, lipid peroxidation reactions produced during digestion are favored due to the acidic environment of the stomach [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This fact could increase the potential damage mediated by free radicals, which have been proposed to play a relevant role in numerous diseases including stomach ulcers and cancer [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Polyphenols can induce protective effects against free radical-induced damage by multiple mechanisms including metal-ion complexation, free radical scavenging, and activation of intracellular detoxifying mechanisms [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, the prevalence of the protective mechanisms induced by polyphenols in epithelial gastric human cells has been poorly understood.</p><p>In this work, we assessed the prevalence of protective mechanisms mediated by polyphenols against the damage induced by free radicals generated by the redox couple H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;+&#x02009;Cu<sup>2+</sup> and thermal decomposition of AAPH, which produce hydroxyl [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and peroxyl radicals [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], respectively.</p><p>Considering that free radical scavenging occurs typically in seconds (lifetime of peroxyl radicals in tissues has been estimated to be 7&#x02009;s) [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and the activation of intracellular protective mechanisms comprises several hours [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], we have hypothesized that coincubations of AGS cells with the PEEs and the free radical sources might reflect protective effects by a direct free radical scavenging and/or metal chelation reactions. On the other hand, preincubations (16&#x02009;h) of cells with the PEEs and a subsequent challenge with free radicals would indicate protective effects mediated by intracellular antioxidant mechanisms.</p><p>Cell viability of AGS cells pre- and coincubated with the different PEEs and exposed to AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals indicates that both mechanisms can induce significant protective effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This fact agrees with numerous reports as well as with the bimolecular rate constants for the reactions between peroxyl radicals and linoleic acid or peroxyl radicals and chlorogenic acid (1&#x000a0;&#x000b7;&#x02009;10<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 1.28&#x000a0;&#x000b7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup>&#x02009;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, resp.) [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This allows the possibility of competitive reactions between cell components, such as membrane lipids and the polyphenols. To determine the prevalence of the main protective mechanisms induced by the studied PEEs, we used the ratio between the area under the curve of cytoprotection mediated by intracellular antioxidant mechanisms over the direct free radical scavenging (evaluated from coincubation conditions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The analysis of the obtained data indicated that intracellular antioxidant mechanism (ICM) was the prevalent protective mechanism induced by polyphenols from the Chilean raspberry <italic>R. geoides</italic> (Las Raices and Lago Blanco samples) and the native strawberry <italic>F. chiloensis</italic>, with 9.5, 23.9, and 13.9%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, only the polyphenols from the currant <italic>Ribes magellanicum</italic> showed that the direct free radical scavenging was the main protective mechanism with a 13.7% over ICM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Employing the mixture H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/Cu<sup>2+</sup> instead of AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals, the study of the cytoprotective effects mediated by PEEs showed, for the extracts of all berries species, that ICM was the prevalent cytoprotective mechanism. It is noteworthy that only the polyphenol employed as control (quercetin) and the extract of <italic>F. chiloensis</italic> presented a significant protection of AGS cells against the oxidative stress induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/Cu<sup>2+</sup> in the coincubation model. This is probably due to Cu<sup>2+</sup> chelation, considering that complexation of Cu<sup>2+</sup> by quercetin has been reported [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This fact is in agreement with the kinetics of the reactions mediated by hydroxyl radicals, which typically present second-order rate constants of ~10<sup>9</sup>&#x02009;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (close to diffusion limit) [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and thus, a protection elicited by scavenging of hydroxyl radicals by polyphenols could not be expected. This behavior validates our findings with peroxyl radicals and provides empirical evidence indicating that polyphenols from our berries as well as vegetables and other fruits could not induce an efficient protection by means of the scavenging of hydroxyl radical [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>To test the hypothesis that co- and preincubations of AGS cells with polyphenols and free radicals involve different mechanisms of cellular protection, we determined the enzymatic activity of Nrf2-regulated enzymes, which constitute one of the final outcomes of the Nrf2 downstream [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The transcription factor Nrf2 coordinates the expression of detoxifying enzymes for survival and defense in stressful conditions [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. For this purpose, the enzymatic activities of the detoxifying enzymes glyoxalase I (GLOI) and glutathione S-transferases (GST) were assessed. Co- and preincubations were performed with the concentrations of the PEEs that presented the best cytoprotective effects against peroxyl radicals. We observed that only preincubations with the PEEs induced a significant increase in the activity of both enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), whereas coincubations did not induce significant changes and even a decrease in the enzymatic activities was observed with some species (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(c)</xref>). A lag period of time between the initiation of the oxidative stress and the expression of Nrf2-regulated enzymes has also been reported in AGS cells stressed with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which have shown to increase the expression of the enzyme heme oxygenase-1 at least after 3&#x02009;h poststress [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. A time-dependent Nrf2-regulated response in the expression of glyoxalase I (with a maximum at 18&#x02009;h after treatment) has also been reported for HepG2 hepatocytes incubated with the microbial compound monascin [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. We have previously reported that preincubations (24&#x02009;h) of AGS cells with the PEEs from <italic>Rubus geoides</italic> induce an increase in the levels of intracellular glutathione as well as protective effects against hydrogen peroxide and methylglyoxal [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The efficiency of the PEEs on the free radical scavenging mechanism was evaluated employing ORAC methods, using as target molecules fluorescein (ORAC-FL) and red pyrogallol (ORAC-PGR). ORAC-FL has been related to the stoichiometry of the reaction between AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals and the antioxidant compound, while ORAC-PGR has been associated with the reactivity (rate of reaction) of polyphenols towards such free radicals [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The PEE from <italic>F. chiloensis</italic> presented the highest value of ORAC-FL and ORAC-PGR, indicating that the PEE from this species was the most efficient to inactivate peroxyl radicals in terms of the stoichiometry of the reaction as well as in terms of the reactivity of its polyphenolic compounds. The phenolic composition of the PEEs from <italic>R. geoides</italic>, <italic>Ribes</italic> spp., and <italic>F. chiloensis</italic> has been previously reported. The PEEs from the selected berries present antioxidant activity, but the chemical composition of the fruit phenolics is very different, as can be expected from different fruit (berries) species [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

We evaluated the cytoprotective effect of the PEE from <italic>F. chiloensis</italic> using two different oxidative stress markers, namely, carboxymethyl lysine (CML) and TBAR levels in both experimental models. Carboxymethyl lysine results from the nonenzymatic posttranslational modification occurring in proteins and is one of the most abundant advanced glycation end products in the human body [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Carboxymethyl lysine levels have shown to be increased in aged tissues, constituting a marker of occurrence of glycoxidative reactions during aging [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This compound can be generated intracellularly by direct reaction with glyoxal, which can be detoxified intracellularly by the glyoxalase system (comprised by glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II) [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Consequently, a decrease in glyoxalase I activity has been associated with increased CML levels [<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. We have found that the PEE from <italic>F. chiloensis</italic>, in the preincubation model, was able to protect AGS cells from the glycoxidative damage reducing the CML relative levels, compared with the peroxyl radical control (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(a)</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(b)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(c)</xref>). This result agrees with the increased levels of electrophile-detoxifying enzymes such as GLOI and GST after preincubation with the PEE from <italic>F. chiloensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This constitutes an interesting finding, considering that the overexpression of GLOI has been shown to increase the longevity of the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> [<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and to retard the senescence of renal proximal tube epithelial cells [<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>The effect of peroxidative damage to lipids was determined using the TBAR method (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(d)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(e)</xref>). Only the coincubation model presented a significant decrease of malondialdehyde levels, implying an inhibition of lipid peroxidation process. It has been reported that Nrf2 activation mediated by lucidine in human keratinocytes (HaCaT) cells can induce a decrease in MDA levels induced by the presence of AAPH [<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The differences observed in the work of Kumar et al. [<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and our results are probably due to different experimental designs. Such authors treated the HaCaT cells with AAPH during 6&#x02009;h, a time that should be enough for MDA diffusion from the cell membrane and to be detoxified intracellularly. We incubated with AAPH during 1&#x02009;h and immediately analyzed the levels of MDA. Nonetheless, our results indicate that despite the effectiveness of coincubation in reducing the MDA levels due to the fast kinetics of free radical scavenging mechanisms, the most relevant cytoprotective mechanism induced by the PEEs from the selected native berries was achieved by intracellular antioxidant mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Our results with the Chilean berries show the potential of these native fruits as sources of natural antioxidants exerting protective effects on AGS cells against free radical-induced damage. Such effect is related to a direct scavenging activity of polyphenols towards free radicals and also to the modulation of pivotal intracellular mechanisms. However, our results clearly demonstrate that the intracellular antioxidant response activation is the main mechanism accounting the protective effect of Chilean berries. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt for developing a model to study the prevalence of cytoprotective mechanisms mediated by polyphenols against the damage induced by free radicals in cell cultures. Establishing the differences in the prevalence of protective mechanisms induced by polyphenols may be useful in the design of novel strategies to maximize the efficiency of healthy effects mediated by dietary polyphenols.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="supplementary-material-sec"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="f1"><caption><p>Figure S1.
