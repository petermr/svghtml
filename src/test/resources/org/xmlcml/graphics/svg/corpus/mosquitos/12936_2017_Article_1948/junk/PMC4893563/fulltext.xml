The objective of this study is to evaluate the acceptability of a training program on the management of depression for primary care health teams.</p><p><bold>Methods</bold>: The study was a randomized controlled trial, and two primary centers from the Metropolitan Region of Santiago were randomly selected to carry out the intervention training program. Pre-post surveys were applied, to evaluate expectations and satisfaction with the intervention, respectively. Descriptive and content analysis was carried out.</p><p><bold>Result</bold>: The sample consisted of 41 health professionals, 56.1% of who reported that their expectations for the intervention were met. All of the training activities were evaluated with scores higher than 6.4 (on a 1&#x02013;7 scale). The trainers, the methodology, and the learning environment were considered strengths and facilitators of the program, while the limited duration of the training, the logistical problems faced during part of the program, and the lack of educational material were viewed as weaknesses.</p><p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: The intervention was well accepted by primary health care teams. However, the clinical impact in patients still has to be evaluated.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>depressive disorder</kwd><kwd>primary health care</kwd><kwd>attitude of health personnel</kwd><kwd>education</kwd><kwd>health care quality assurance</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient&#x000ed;fico y Tecnol&#x000f3;gico<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002850</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">1130230</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="5"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="35"/><page-count count="6"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>In Chile, depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders in adult population, with a six-month prevalence of 4.7% (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Vicente et al., 2002</xref>) and a one-week prevalence of 5.5% (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Araya et al., 2001</xref>), and it is the second leading cause of disability-adjusted life years for both sexes (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Ministry of Health (Chile), 2008</xref>), making it one of the principal public health problems in the country.</p><p>The results of the 2009&#x02013;2010 Chilean National Health Survey indicated that 17.2% of the general population suffered from depressive symptoms in the last year, and that 21.2% reported having been diagnosed with depression at some point in their lives (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Ministry of Health (Chile), 2011</xref>). Among individuals attending primary care centers, an international study conducted by the WHO showed that the highest prevalence of depression was detected in Santiago, Chile (29.5%), while the lowest was in Nagasaki, Japan (2.6%; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Goldberg and Lecrubier, 1995</xref>).</p><p>In response to the high prevalence of depression in primary care settings, international evidence has suggested the use of stepwise treatment with multiple components for management of the illness, offering different levels of complexity, and different combinations of psychosocial, pharmacological, and/or psychotherapy interventions, according to the severity of the case (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Katon et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>In line with these recommendations, a randomized controlled trial was carried out, taking into account the idiosyncrasies of the Chilean primary care system, in which professionals who are not physicians provide a large portion of the interventions in these centers. The results of this study were promising, with the active group having a recovery rate of 70% compared to a 30% rate in the control group, after 3 months; the differences between the groups were still significant at the six-month follow-up (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Araya et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>This evidence, demonstrating primary-care-based intervention to be effective, as well as cost-effective (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Araya et al., 2006</xref>), was instrumental to the decision to implement a National Program for the Detection, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Depression in all primary care centers in Chile (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Ministry of Health (Chile), 2000</xref>). Furthermore, due to the magnitude of this public health problem (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Ministry of Health (Chile), 2008</xref>), in 2006, all individuals over the age of 15 with depression were ensured universal access to treatment, through the National Explicit Health Guarantees program (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Ministry of Health (Chile), 2006</xref>).</p><p>Currently, more than 80% of depressed patients in the Chilean public health care system are treated by primary care teams (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Minoletti et al., 2012</xref>). However, evaluations of the National Depression Program have identified numerous barriers impeding effective management of the condition, such as the under-estimation of depression severity, which leads to the provision of treatment that does not align with the patients&#x02019; clinical presentations, and does not corresponds to the clinical practice guidelines for depression (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Alvarado et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Alvarado and Rojas, 2011</xref>).</p><p>This situation is not limited to Chile. International evidence has also found that the management of depression is not always consistent with clinical guidelines; sub-detection of the illness, insufficient treatment, excessive use of psycho-medication, and scarce use of cognitive-behavioral interventions are fairly common occurrences (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Willemse et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Lecrubier, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Because the multidisciplinary health teams in Chilean primary care settings are the gateway into the health system for a significant portion of patients, and considering that implementation of the National Depression Program does not include a training component for these health teams, the authors saw the need to train members of primary care teams to improve the detection, diagnosis, and treatment options provided to individuals with depression (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Sikorski et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The objective of this article is to assess the acceptability of a training program in depression management for primary health care teams in Chile.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This manuscript presents an evaluation of the acceptability of the first component of the randomized controlled trial &#x0201c;Comprehensive Technology-Assisted Training and Supervision Program to Enhance Depression Management in Primary Care,&#x0201d; corresponding to the training portion of the program. The results from the health teams of two CESFAM in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago, Chile, randomized to the study&#x02019;s intervention arm, are presented.</p><p>The selection of the CESFAM for the study was carried out in two steps. First, two urban municipalities from the Metropolitan Region, with clinical campuses of the Universidad de Chile, were randomly selected. Municipalities were excluded if they had a high Human Development Index, a high percentage of immigrants, a large proportion of older adults, and/or psychiatry residents working in primary care centers. Secondly, in the two selected municipalities, two CESFAM were randomly chosen, with one assigned to the intervention arm and the other to the control arm of the study.</p><p>The training program was designed by a group of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and educators from the Universidad de Chile Faculty of Medicine and Clinical Hospital.</p><p>The content of the intervention was based on recommendations from the Clinical Guidelines for Depression in Individuals older than 15 years of age (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Ministry of Health (Chile), 2013</xref>) and included topics related to the detection, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of depression, with a multi-disciplinary perspective, considering different levels of illness severity (mild, moderate, and severe).</p><p>The training was carried out in the CCA of the Medical School of Universidad de Chile, with two, 12-h sessions held for each group. Overall, five groups were trained in April, September, and October 2014, for a total of 60 h of training in 10 sessions.</p><p>The following educational activates were included in the training: oral expositions, analysis of clinical cases, role playing to practice clinical interviewing and problem solving, and a OSCE, along with clinical simulations with standardized patients.</p><p>An open-ended survey was given to all participants before and after the training program, to explore their expectations prior to starting the program, the degree to which their expectations were met, and their perceptions of the program&#x02019;s strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>In addition, immediately after the training program, a closed seven-item survey, with response options on a Likert scale (1&#x02013;7, with 1 being &#x0201c;very bad&#x0201d; and 7 &#x0201c;very good&#x0201d;) was completed by the participants, to evaluate the various activities included in the program.

Thus, the training program&#x02019;s use of existing human resources, and the fact that it seeks to respond to the specific educational needs of each team member, by covering concepts ranging from low-complexity interventions, such as illness detection, to those that require greater specificity and degrees of coordination, are great strengths of the intervention (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Ministry of Health (Chile), 2000</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, while there are studies in the literature that incorporate patients&#x02019; or health teams&#x02019; acceptability of and/or satisfaction with depression treatments (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Capoccia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Neumeyer-Gromen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Katon and Seelig, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Stevenson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Un&#x000fc;tzer and Park, 2012</xref>), international evidence on health teams&#x02019; acceptability and/or satisfaction with the educational components of clinical trials for the management of depression is scarce, although the findings of the few existing studies are homogenous: participants evaluate training programs as acceptable, relevant, and useful for clinical practice (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Stevens et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Ekers et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In these clinical trials, though the health professionals and/or interventions vary from one study to another, the training programs are quite similar, in terms of format; the educational components are comprised of lectures and discussions to deliver theoretical knowledge, and the acquisition of clinical skills is reinforced through the use of audiovisual material and role playing (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Stevens et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Ekers et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>There are, however, discrepancies observed in the results of these clinical trials. One of the studies increased the likelihood that nurses detected and correctly referred depression cases, finding significant clinical improvement (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Ekers et al., 2011</xref>), and another, which tested a program with nurses who provided behavioral activation for depressed adults, achieved cost-effective results (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bruce et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, an educational program based on clinical guidelines to improve illness recognition and clinical outcomes of depressed patients treated by primary care physicians failed to demonstrate these improvements (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The training format used in these trials was virtually the same as the one described in the present study; none of these trials, however, included a formative OSCE as one of their educational strategies.</p><p>Other studies that did incorporate a OSCE in health team training had positive results in terms of the acquisition of clinical skills (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Falluco et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this regard, systematic reviews of clinical trials of depression management programs, which included an educational intervention, concludes that individualized training sessions&#x02014;even with specific methodology&#x02014;did not improve patient outcomes; in contrast, the use of complex training strategies, that consider clinical practice guidelines and feedback and actively involve health teams, achieved a moderate change in the clinical management of depression in primary care services and in patients&#x02019; symptomatology (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gilbody et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Sikorski et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In light of the evidence reviewed thus far, it seems reasonable to assume that the training program described in this manuscript could result in improved depression management by participating health teams and in significant positive clinical outcomes for patients. This evaluation is pending, however, since the trial is still in the recruitment phase.</p><p>A few limitations of this study should be reviewed. First, the small sample of health professionals is a limitation, especially considering the large number of professionals and health teams working primary care centers in Chile, which are greatly heterogeneous in terms of available resources, their prioritization of resources for mental health services, and the characteristics of the populations they served, among other factors. Second, this study did not collect information on various individual or group variables with respect to the participating professionals, such as their number of years of experience working in primary care, the time they dedicate to seeing mental health patents, and their prior level of knowledge on depression, which could influence both their evaluation of the training program, and the impact of the program on patients&#x02019; clinical outcomes. Additionally, the motivation for professionals&#x02019; behavioral change was not considered for the present study, although it is a variable that has been shown to be important for the practical implementation of content covered in training programs (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Shirazi et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The participants themselves identified two weaknesses for the training program which should be considered: (i) the short duration of the program, and (ii) the lack of educational material made available to them. In this vein, the caseload burden of primary care health teams significantly limits professionals&#x02019; time availability, open for training, though the duration of training program could be extended in the form of continuing booster sessions, to consolidate skill development, address problems in clinical practice, and cover any issues that the participants feel are pending. Regarding the second aspect, the training program should provide participants additional support, by expanding the availability and increasing the relevance of educational material.</p><p>Finally, future studies should determine not only if this depression management training program is effective in the local Chilean population, and for national public mental health policies, but also if the intervention model could be applied in primary care settings of other countries, where depression remains an unsolved public health problem.</p><p>In summary, it can be concluded that the training program was accepted by primary care health teams, and although some participants thought that certain aspects of the program could be improved, there was a high level of satisfaction with the intervention, and it coincided with the professionals&#x02019; preferences, which could indicate that its future application with other health teams could be well received. Nevertheless, investigators still have to evaluate if this training program translates into better clinical results for depressed patients, who attend Chilean primary care centers.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>RM contributed to the planning of the training evaluations, the data analysis, the preparation of the manuscript and its final approval.
