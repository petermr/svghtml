We identified all discordant recommendations as of January 2015, and pairs of reviewers independently classified them either into one of the five appropriate paradigms or into one of three categories inconsistent with GRADE guidance, based on the evidence presented in UpToDate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>UpToDate included 9451 GRADE recommendations, of which 6501 (68.8%) were formulated as weak recommendations and 2950 (31.2%) as strong. Among the strong, 844 (28.6%) were based on high certainty in effect estimates, 1740 (59.0%) on moderate certainty and 366 (12.4%) on low certainty. Of the 349 discordant recommendations 204 (58.5%) were judged appropriately (consistent with one of the five paradigms); we classified 47 (13.5%) as good practice statements; 38 (10.9%) misclassified the evidence as low certainty when it was at least moderate and 60 (17.2%) warranted a weak rather than a strong recommendation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The proportion of discordant recommendations in UpToDate is small (3.7% of all recommendations) and the proportion that is truly problematic (strong recommendations that would best have been weak) is very small (0.6%).

Some guidelines have a clear surfeit of discordant recommendations. For example, of 456 recommendations in 116 WHO guidelines, 160 (35%) proved discordant.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Similarly, 121 of 357 (34%) recommendations in 17 Endocrine Society Guidelines proved discordant.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref></p><p>Though discordant recommendations often represent a violation of GRADE guidance, this is not always the case. GRADE has identified five seldom-occurring paradigmatic situations in which a strong recommendation is warranted despite low certainty in the evidence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 13</xref> Furthermore, there is more than one explanation for an apparent violation of GRADE guidance (a discordant recommendation that fails to meet one of these criteria). First, the discordant recommendation may actually represent a good practice statement, in which indirect evidence justifies an inference that the recommended management option is far superior to the alternative.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Indirect evidence refers to evidence that does not directly address the question at hand but nevertheless bears on the question. For instance, though there are no randomised trials of use of a parachute after jumping out of plane, there is ample indirect evidence suggesting its impact on mortality from the jump. Second, the panel may have misclassified the certainty of the evidence (it may actually be moderate or high). Third, and most concerning, the optimal management option is, in fact, value and preference&#x000a0;sensitive and the panel should have issued a weak recommendation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">table 2</xref>).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 13</xref></p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Paradigmatic situations in which a strong recommendation may be warranted despite low or very low certainty in effect estimates (appropriate strength, consistent with Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation&#x000a0;(GRADE))</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td valign="bottom" rowspan="2" align="left" colspan="1">Situation</td><td valign="bottom" colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">Certainty in estimates <break/>(quality of evidence)</td><td valign="bottom" rowspan="2" align="left" colspan="1">Balance of benefits and harms</td><td valign="bottom" rowspan="2" align="left" colspan="1">Values&#x000a0;and preferences</td><td valign="bottom" rowspan="2" align="left" colspan="1">Resource considerations</td><td valign="bottom" rowspan="2" align="left" colspan="1">Recommendation</td><td valign="bottom" rowspan="2" align="left" colspan="1">Example</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Benefits</td><td valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Harms</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.

In doing so, we restricted ourselves to the evidence presented in UpToDate rather than conducting our own literature review.

They abstracted the following information related to each discordant recommendation:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Patient population (clinical field and age group);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Type of intervention (drug, procedure, device, etc) and type of comparator (existing standard care, no intervention, alternative intervention, etc);</p></list-item><list-item><p>The clarity of the comparator, classified as (1) clearly and explicitly stated; (2) not clearly and explicitly stated, but obvious; (3) not clearly and explicitly stated or obvious but relatively easy to infer; (4) not at all clear&#x02014;uncertain;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Outcomes: whether there was an explicit statement on mortality as well as the balance of benefits and harms;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Whether there was an explicit statement on the relative importance of outcomes and/or on patients&#x02019; values and preferences in making the trade-offs between alternative courses of action;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Whether issues of cost or resources were explicitly discussed;</p></list-item><list-item><p>The evidence supporting the recommendation both for systematic reviews and primary study designs (randomised trials, observational studies, etc)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Whether the evidence summary suggested large effects in critical outcomes, or that indirect evidence, not incorporated in the grading, seemed to drive the recommendation.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Based on this abstracted information, each reviewer independently classified each of the discordant recommendations as either consistent with one of the five previously identified optimal categories for discordant recommendations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>)<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 10 13</xref> or in one of three categories in which we judged discordant recommendations to be inconsistent with GRADE guidance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">table 2</xref>): (1) good practice statements; (2) a misclassification of the evidence&#x02014;the evidence warranted moderate or high certainty rather than low or (3) uncertainty in the estimates of effect would best lead to a weak recommendation. We assessed agreement for whether recommendations were appropriate (vs inappropriate) according to GRADE guidance using the chance-corrected kappa statistic. The reviewers resolved all disagreements by discussion or through referral to an additional reviewer.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Data analysis and reporting</title><p>We abstracted data in an MS Excel database V.14.4 with prespecified response categories whenever possible and exported in SPSS V.22.0 for analysis.

Of all recommendations, only 3.7% (n=349) were strong recommendations based on low certainty in effect estimates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">table 3</xref>). Of these discordant recommendations, over half were consistent with one of the five paradigmatic situations in which it is appropriate to offer discordant recommendations; approximately 14% represented &#x02018;good practice statements&#x02019;; approximately 11% were based on a misclassification of certainty (evidence warranted moderate or high certainty) and approximately 17% were judged to warrant a weak recommendation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">table 5</xref>). The proportion of appropriate discordant recommendations varied across intervention types or clinical fields (online&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP2">supplementary file 2</xref>). Although most topics in UpToDate provided a rationale to support the discordant recommendation, 29% lacked statements about benefits and harms and 13% did not provide citations, which points at potential areas of improvement for UpToDate related to standards for trustworthy guidelines.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study assessed the strength of recommendations in the largest known sample of recommendations developed using GRADE. Indeed, even large guidelines include a few hundred recommendations,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> whereas UpToDate topics have one of the largest known coverage in clinical fields and included 9451 recommendations at the time of this assessment.</p><p>The taxonomy that we used has been successfully implemented in two prior studies of clinical guidelines<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> (see below: relation to prior work). Our reviewers could all be characterised as expert GRADE methodologists: they were clinical epidemiologists with an in-depth understanding of GRADE methodology acquired through the&#x000a0;use of GRADE in a large number of assessments over a period of years and were therefore well equipped to assess judgements on evidence and recommendations. This differs markedly from UpToDate authors (some with little understanding of GRADE) and UpToDate editors (all of whom have received basic GRADE training but some little more than that). Despite the advanced skills of our reviewers, chance-corrected kappa agreement on the appropriateness of recommendations was moderate (0.48).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Consensus discussions were needed for 43% of discordant recommendations, although formal adjudication by third parties was required for only 12 discordant recommendations (3.4%).</p><p>The necessity for frequent consensus discussions reflects the substantial judgement required in categorising recommendations. This is in part due to the narrative nature of UpToDate topics, which does not include formal summary of finding tables or evidence profiles,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> often discussing the evidence and rationale for several recommendations in a free-text cross-referenced structure that sometimes omits statements regarding benefits and harms and lacks citations. The one previous study using this taxonomy that addressed chance-corrected agreement reported a kappa of 0.68. The higher kappa may well be a result of more explicit reporting with use of summary of findings tables in the WHO guidelines that were the subject of investigation. The concern regarding the need for consensus discussions is perhaps increased because a single team using a single system of categorisation undertook the study. A further limitation of our study is that decisions were based solely on information published in UpToDate, while authors of the topics may have considered other factors.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Another element contributing to the challenges in making categorisations is the clarity of the comparison on which the recommendation applies. As in previous assessment in guidelines,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> the comparator was clearly and explicitly stated in only 73 (20.9%) of discordant recommendations and was uncertain in 46 (13.2%). When comparators were not clear and explicit, reviewers&#x02019; inferences may not always have been correct.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Relation to previous work</title><p>Two prior studies provided a formal structured exploration of discordant recommendations using the GRADE approach. An assessment of 357 recommendations in 17 Endocrine Society Guidelines found that only 29% of discordant recommendations were consistent with one of the five paradigmatic situations.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A second study of 456 recommendations in 116 WHO guidelines using GRADE found that of 160 discordant recommendations, only 15.6% were judged consistent with GRADE guidance.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref></p><p>Our results contrast with these previous two studies. First, the proportion of weak recommendations was approximately 30% higher in UpToDate than in WHO and Endocrine Society guidelines. This proportion was, however, similar to the ninth edition American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guideline on Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, after it implemented GRADE.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 20</xref> Second, the proportion of inappropriate, discordant recommendation was considerably lower. Of the discordant recommendations, the proportion that should have been weak was about 17% rather than 27% (Endocrine Society)<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> or 46% (WHO guidelines).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>A subsequent interview of panel members involved in the WHO guidelines highlighted reasons contributing to discordant recommendations. These included political considerations around long-established practices, the need for funding and policy formulation, or the fear of pushback from media.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Panel members also expressed scepticism regarding the value of making weak recommendations, or concerns they may be ignored,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> although another study reported that WHO weak recommendations are frequently adopted in national policies (uptake of 61% for weak recommendations versus 82% for strong recommendations).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Finally, the authors identified both financial and intellectual conflicts of interest among panel members as an explanation for discordant recommendations.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 22</xref> Any or all of these factors may have contributed to UpToDate discordant recommendations.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Implications and conclusion</title><p>For users of UpToDate, our results are generally, though not absolutely, reassuring. The proportion of discordant recommendations is very small&#x02014;only 3.7% of all recommendations. Furthermore, of the three categories inconsistent with GRADE guidance&#x02014; good practice statement, misclassification of the certainty and evidence warranting a weak recommendation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">table 2</xref>)&#x02014;the third is by far the most problematic.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Good practice statements are appropriate when indirect evidence that is difficult to collect and summarise warrants high certainty in the impact of a given intervention and when the balance benefits and harms is large.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Thus, in terms of implications for clinical practice, good practice statements have the same force as strong recommendations. Similarly with misclassification of certainty: since the certainty is actually moderate or high, a strong recommendation is appropriate. Recommendations that should have been weak instead of strong provide inappropriate &#x02018;just do it&#x02019; guidance for clinical practice, although they are actually preference&#x000a0;sensitive and should thus warrant shared&#x000a0;decision-making.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Of the 349 discordant recommendations in UpToDate, only 60 fall in the category of inappropriate strong recommendations.</p><p>Thus, clinicians using UpToDate can anticipate that they will be misleadingly instructed to take a &#x02018;just do it&#x02019; rather than an &#x02018;it depends&#x02019; approach to clinical decision-making in 0.6% (6 of 1000) UpToDate recommendations.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This seems close to a threshold in which one might ignore the problem. Nevertheless, we would still encourage clinicians to be alert to the possibility of an inappropriate strong recommendation&#x02014;in UpToDate or elsewhere&#x02014;whenever the recommendation is based on low certainty evidence and authors fail to provide an explicit rationale corresponding to one of the categories in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>.</p><p>A likely explanation for UpToDate&#x02019;s success in avoiding inappropriate discordant recommendations is the training and feedback that their deputy editors receive. For organisations using GRADE, our results suggest the desirability of such training for those involved in formulating recommendations to optimise use of GRADE.</p><p>Finally, our results highlight the need for authors of trustworthy recommendations or guidelines<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> to provide clear and explicit comparators, as well as transparent and systematic reports of the key ingredients of their rationale when moving from evidence to recommendation.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 23 24</xref> Future avenues for research should also look at optimal presentation formats of Evidence-Based Medicine textbooks and guidelines, to ensure clinicians actually understand both the rationale and potential implications of all recommendations for clinical practice.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 25&#x02013;28</xref></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e379" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018593.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e380" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018593.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> TA and GHG designed the study.
