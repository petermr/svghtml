Their functions range from nursing neurons to forming the blood-brain barrier. Under pro-inflammatory conditions induced by injury or neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), astrocytes become reactive and take on a more stellate shape, while increasing in number and size. At the same time, the expression of several proteins is enhanced, including that of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This reactive process is referred to as astrogliosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Astrogliosis has been recognized as an inhibitory cue for axon regeneration. Nevertheless, it may have initial benefits for the injured area, since astrocytes restrict any damage to a small area, repair the blood brain barrier, and eliminate toxic factors from the surrounding area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. During astrogliosis, several molecules are released into the extracellular space, including ATP, adenosine, and a number of cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. One of the most important cytokines released to the injured area is tumor necrosis factor (TNF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which acts as an alert signal that induces reactivity of the neighboring astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Reactive astrocytes are a heterogeneous population of cells, and recent in vivo studies indicate that some astrocytes proliferate, while for another subset of labeled astrocytes hypertrophy and polarization, but not overt migration towards the site of injury are detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, several previously reported studies indicate that reactive astrocytes migrate to the damaged zone and form the glial scar, repairing the wounded area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The protein osteopontin is among the various stimuli that induce cell migration; this requires interaction with &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Importantly, reactive astrocytes have been shown to express increased levels of &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin, the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), and the hemichannels Connexin-43 and Pannexin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. All these molecules are reportedly involved in astrocyte migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">The neuronal surface glycoprotein Thy-1 binds to astrocytes and thereby promotes adhesion and migration, processes that our group has studied in depth. Thy-1-induced adhesion and migration require interaction with the &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin and Syndecan-4 receptors. These interactions trigger the recruitment of focal adhesion (FA) proteins and activate a signaling module, which in turn leads to the activation of the small GTPase RhoA and its effector ROCK and results in changes in the astrocyte actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The signaling cascade also includes the opening of the hemichannels Connexin-43 and Pannexin-1 and the release of ATP to the extracellular milieu, where it activates P2X7R, allowing calcium entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. After a more prolonged stimulation, Thy-1 induces the activation of FAK, PI3-kinase, and the GTPase Rac1, thus leading to astrocyte migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">We have previously studied the Thy-1-induced signaling cascade using the DITNC1 astrocyte cell line. Considering that, in primary astrocytes, many of the molecules forming part of the Thy-1-induced signaling pathway are only present in low amounts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], we hypothesized that primary astrocytes would be refractory to Thy-1 stimulus. Additionally, many signaling proteins, including the Thy-1 receptors, are upregulated under pro-inflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We therefore decided to directly study the effect of a pro-inflammatory environment on the response of primary astrocytes to Thy-1, and on the Thy-1-induced signaling cascade in these cells. This was achieved in two ways. Firstly, primary astrocytes were treated with the pro-inflammatory signaling factor TNF prior to Thy-1 application, comparing the results to those obtained from controls that had not been exposed to TNF. Secondly, astrocytes were used derived from an ALS model, a neurodegenerative disorder marked by neuroinflammation and the presence of reactive astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">ALS is a late-onset disease, which generally appears after 50&#x000a0;years of age. It is characterized by motor neuron dysfunction and degeneration and leads to death from respiratory failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Astrocytes from ALS patient samples are activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and show increased levels of Connexin-43 and GFAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In murine ALS models, astrocytes are activated within a time frame before the onset of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Additionally, these reactive astrocytes are now recognized to assist ALS motor neuronal death by secreting inflammatory factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. To study the effect of Thy-1 signaling on astrocytes developing under the ALS neuroinflammatory conditions, the transgenic mouse carrying the human G93A mutated super oxide dismutase 1 (hSOD1<sup>G93A</sup>) was employed, the most widely used ALS model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">As discussed above, Thy-1-mediated astrocyte adhesion and migration relies on the &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin receptor. Because &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin is upregulated in the presence of TNF in various cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], it could be hypothesized that the effect of TNF on astrocyte reactivity is related to &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin expression. To further explore the role of this receptor molecule, Thy-1 signaling in primary astrocytes was therefore investigated, in which &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin expression had been either silenced or upregulated, both in the presence and absence of TNF.</p><p id="Par21">Here, we show that primary astrocytes only responded to Thy-1 in a pro-inflammatory environment (+TNF), where proteins participating in the Thy-1 response were upregulated. In addition, neonatal primary astrocytes derived from a mouse model of ALS (hSOD1<sup>G93A</sup>) were found to express higher levels of reactivity markers and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin, Syndecan-4, Connexin-43, and Pannexin-1 than those derived from wild-type non-transgenic littermates. The hSOD1<sup>G93A</sup>-derived astrocytes responded to Thy-1 without the need of cytokine addition. Importantly, in investigating the role of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin in Thy-1-induced FA and astrocyte migration, over-expression of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin was found to be sufficient to render primary astrocytes reactive and consequently responsive to Thy-1 stimulation in the absence of TNF. Conversely, silencing of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin precluded the effect of Thy-1 on TNF-treated astrocytes. These results favor a working model in which inflammation enhances &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin expression, rendering astrocytes responsive to Thy-1 and thereby promoting their adhesion and migration, as required during the repair of the injured brain. Controlling &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin levels modulated astrocyte reactivity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par22">The care and use of rodents is detailed in protocols approved by the bioethical Committees of the Universidad de Chile and Universidad Andres Bello.

Notably, &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin over-expression led to increased levels for many other key components of the Thy-1 response, including Syndecan-4, P2X7R, Connexin-43, and Pannexin-1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Together, these results indicate that &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin over-expression is sufficient to permit Thy-1-induced migration of primary astrocytes, without the requirement for TNF treatment, and that this effect might be due to a role for &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin in controlling the expression of other key components of the Thy-1 signaling pathway.</p><p id="Par42">To confirm that the effect of Thy-1 on wild-type primary astrocytes is mediated through the interaction of Thy-1 and &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin, a mutant Thy-1 carrying an amino acid substitution in the &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin-binding domain was used to stimulate TNF-treated astrocytes. Impaired functionality of this mutated protein has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Our results show that, in contrast to wild-type Thy-1, mutant Thy-1 did not induce astrocyte migration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>) confirming the importance of Thy-1/&#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin interaction in the reported effects.</p><p id="Par43">Having confirmed &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin as a crucial mediator of Thy-1-triggered adhesion and migration, processes shown here to be limited to reactive astrocytes, and considering its upregulation in the presence of TNF, we were curious to explore whether the over-expression of this integrin had any general effects on astrocyte reactivity. The levels of the known markers of astrocyte reactivity iNOS and GFAP in pEGFP-&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin transfected astrocytes by western blotting were therefore evaluated.

In addition, vinculin and F-actin staining of non-transgenic and hSOD1<sup>G93A</sup>-derived astrocytes revealed differences in their FAs and actin cytoskeleton. Astrocytes from non-transgenic mice were round in shape with low levels of FAs, while hSOD1<sup>G93A</sup>-derived astrocytes were polygonal with better-defined actin stress fibers and fewer focal contacts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, upper panels).

Here, we show that wild-type primary astrocytes respond to Thy-1 by adhering and migrating only under inflammatory conditions (+TNF). We also show that in primary astrocytes, Thy-1 induces similar signaling pathways to those reported for DITNC1 astrocytes, namely, hemichannel opening, ATP release, activation of P2X7R, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, early cell adhesion, and finally, cell polarization and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In addition, hSOD1<sup>G93A</sup>-derived astrocytes respond to Thy-1 without any requirement for additional cytokines. Of note, ectopically expressed &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin increases the levels of other important players of the Thy-1-induced signaling pathways, including Syndecan-4 and the Connexin-43/Pannexin-1 hemichannels, as well as markers of reactive astrocytes, such as iNOS and GFAP. Furthermore, over-expression of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin is sufficient to render astrocytes responsive to Thy-1. Therefore, we propose that &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin plays a preponderant role in determining Thy-1-induced effects in astrocytes and possibly also in controlling astrocyte reactivity.</p><p id="Par50">After injury to the CNS, microglia generate a pro-inflammatory environment by liberating TNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This has been shown to enhance the expression of integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and cell adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In our studies, TNF induced astrocyte reactivity, increasing the expression levels of reported markers of astrocytosis as well as the Thy-1 receptors &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin and Syndecan-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Thy-1 receptor upregulation enables cells to respond to the ligand and thereby initiate astrocyte adhesion and migration. These findings suggest that a pro-inflammatory environment is required for astrocytes to become responsive to neuronal signals such as Thy-1. The low levels of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin observed in primary astrocytes may explain the unresponsiveness of these cells to Thy-1. In this context, it is of interest that TNF also induces &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin expression, along with a &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin-dependent cell migration, in endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]; this indicates that increased &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin expression is relevant to migration under pro-inflammatory conditions in other cellular models.</p><p id="Par51">In the present study, the application of TNF to primary astrocytes leads to an increased expression of &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin, Syndecan-4, P2X7R, Connexin-43, and Pannexin-1. All of these molecules have previously been shown to be required for Thy-1-induced cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Others have reported that Connexin-43 hemichannnels are activated by treating astrocytes with a mixture of TNF and IL-1&#x003b2;. This leads to neuronal death, an effect not observed in astrocytes lacking Connexin-43 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Moreover, prenatal exposure to LPS, a well-known pro-inflammatory agent, induces activation of astrocytes with increased levels of Connexin-43 and Pannexin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Additionally, treating astrocytes with TNF for only 3&#x000a0;h induces expression of Connexin-43 hemichannels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. These results suggest that primary astrocytes exposed to a pro-inflammatory environment upregulate surface receptors involved in the Thy-1-Integrin-induced signaling pathways.</p><p id="Par52">ATP release from hemichannels activated P2X7R and thus increased intracellular calcium, only after TNF treatment. ATP release and P2X7R activation has been previously shown to be involved in Thy-1-induced astrocyte responses, first inducing cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and subsequently migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Of note, increased levels of ATP have been associated with brain damage in humans. Patients with radiation-induced brain injury show high levels of extracellular ATP, IL-6, and TNF in cephalorachidian fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. In addition, exposure of primary astroglial cultures to radiation increases extracellular levels of ATP, IL-6, and TNF, unless P2X7R is inhibited or silenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. This suggests an important role for ATP and P2X7R in the activation of glial cultures and progression of brain injuries. Recently, increased expression of P2X7R and Connexin-43 has been linked to astrogliosis in autoimmune encephalomyelitis, where the increase of P2X7R coincided with the appearance of astrocyte reactivity markers, such as GFAP and S100&#x003b2;. The addition of P2X7R blockers led to a reduction in astrogliosis markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], suggesting that the increase in P2X7R is involved in astrocyte reactivity. In line with this, published evidence indicates that P2X7R over-expression leads to microglia activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. In the present study, P2X7R protein levels increased after TNF treatment, while the inhibition of P2X7R and the apyrase-catalyzed reduction of extracellular ATP both decreased Thy-1-induced astrocyte migration. However, it remains to be determined whether <italic>P2X7R</italic> is a direct or an indirect target of TNF.</p><p id="Par53">The increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> induced by Thy-1 stimulus is necessary for astrocyte migration. Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores via stimulation of IP3R participate in Thy-1-induced astrocyte migration, since P2X7R silencing as well as the addition of IP3R inhibitors prevent the migration of astrocytes with a reactive phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition, the calcium-chelator BAPTA-AM blocks Thy-1-induced hemichannel opening and ATP release, two key steps in the process of Thy-1-induced DITNC1 astrocyte migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In agreement with our observations, Fang and coworkers published that Orexin, a neuropeptide that evokes responses similar to those triggered by Thy-1 in astrocytes, induces migration in rat astrocytes in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner, which can be blocked by either the addition of BAPTA-AM or an IP3R blocker, such as 2-APB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], supporting the notion that increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is necessary for astrocyte migration.</p><p id="Par54">In primary astrocytes, TNF treatment is required for the Thy-1 response; however, TNF by itself neither induces migration nor increases Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), but rather promotes changes in protein expression to generate a migratory phenotype responsive to Thy-1.

Interestingly, &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin over-expression was sufficient to enable primary astrocytes to respond to Thy-1, thereby showing an effect similar to that of TNF treatment. Others have reported an increased cell migration, invasion and tumorigenesis of cancer cells over-expressing &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin following stimulation with osteopontin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], an extracellular matrix protein, which is upregulated and secreted after TNF treatment, and which induces directional astrocyte migration in an &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This is in line with our findings, since it indicates that increased levels of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin protein make cells more responsive to external cues. However, over-expression of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin alone does not induce tumorigenesis in the absence of osteopontin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. This is paralleled by our own observation that in the absence of Thy-1, migration was not increased in &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin over-expressing astrocytes, confirming that elevated levels of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin render astrocytes sensitive to the neuronal Thy-1, rather than increasing cell autonomous migration. The intriguing possibility that increased &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin expression might guide reactive astrocytes to regions rich in &#x0201c;damage&#x0201d; signals, allowing them to interact with neuronal Thy-1 in the damaged zone, awaits further studies.</p><p id="Par56">Furthermore, &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin appears to control the expression of other proteins involved in the Thy-1 response. It has been reported that &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin acts upstream of NF-&#x003ba;B in several cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] and that tyrosine 759 of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin is required for NF-&#x003ba;B activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], suggesting that this pathway, or a similar one, might be activated upon over-expression of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin. Like &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin, the expression of the Thy-1 co-receptor, Syndecan-4, is also increased in an NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent manner when EAhy926 cells are treated with TNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. It is possible that NF-&#x003ba;B activation might increase expression of the surface proteins reported in the present study in response to TNF. In hepatocytes from acute-on-chronic liver failure, increased levels of NF-&#x003ba;B are associated with increased expression of Connexin-43, but not Connexin-26 or Connexin-32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. In isolated aorta sections, Connexin-43 levels are increased downstream of NF-&#x003ba;B and ERK1/2 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Additionally, IL-8 regulates &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin expression in a PI3K/Akt/NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Similarly, when glioblastoma multiforme cells are treated with the phorbol ester PMA, NF-&#x003ba;B induces the expression of &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin along with fibronectin and vitronectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. This suggests a possible role for NF-&#x003ba;B in upregulating the expression of components in the Thy-1 activated pathway. Consequently, &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin could be placed upstream or downstream of NF-&#x003ba;B. Considering that &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin over-expression is sufficient to increase the expression of reactive astrocyte markers and to render astrocytes sensitive to Thy-1 stimulation in the absence of TNF, and since &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin silencing precludes the effect of Thy-1 in TNF-treated cells, we propose that &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin expression can control astrocyte reactivity. Whether it does so by activating NF-&#x003ba;B remains to be assessed.</p><p id="Par57">To place our findings into a patho-physiological context, astrocytes were analyzed from the hSOD1<sup>G93A</sup> ALS mouse model. In this model, astrocytes are reported to be reactive before the onset motor symptoms, and the degree of reactivity correlates with the neurodegenerative process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Elevated expression levels of GFAP, Vimentin, and CD44 in tissue sections from post-mortem spinal cord in ALS patients also indicate astrocyte reactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Here, Thy-1 is shown to induce adhesion and migration of hSOD1<sup>G93A</sup>-derived astrocytes without the need of prior TNF treatment.

Consistent with this, we observed low levels of P2X7R in hSOD1<sup>G93A</sup> astrocytes, suggesting that these levels are sufficient for Thy-1-induced migration.

Notably, unlike P2X7R, Pannexin-1, Syndecan-4, and &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> Integrin expression levels were increased.
