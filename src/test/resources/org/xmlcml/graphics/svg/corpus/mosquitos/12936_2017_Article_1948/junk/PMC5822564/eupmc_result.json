    "Third molar removal surgery is the most frequently performed surgery in the oral and maxillofacial field with a wide range of items in the quantification of postoperative complications. For their measure, in 2014 a previous scale design was presented. The aim of this study was to determine the reliability and validity of a scale designed to measure and quantify postoperative complications in third molar surgery (TMS).A cross-sectional study of a measurement model was designed. Sixty-two patients (mean age 20.5 ± 6.6 years; 36 women) underwent TMS in three Chilean hospitals. In the postoperative check-up on the 7th day, a maxillofacial surgeon and a surgical resident performed independent postoperative assessments, applying the scale. A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to obtain validity, internal consistency, interobserver reliability and a score to categorize the severity of complications using structural equation model analysis.Nine patients (14.5%) had complications. The scale was defined by two components: \"Secondary complication\" and \"Infection\" (Cronbach's alpha 0.71; Interobserver reliability 87.7%) and three categories of postoperative complication: \"without or mild\", \"moderate\" and \"severe\".This study presents a reliability and validity scale called \"Surgical complication assessment scale in TMS\"."
