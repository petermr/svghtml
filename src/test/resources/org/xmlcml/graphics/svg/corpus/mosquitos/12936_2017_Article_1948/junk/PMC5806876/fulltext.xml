This study explored microbiological metrics according to national target and critical values valid for samples at consumer level of 498 fresh poultry meat and 136 fresh pork filets from consignments subjected to physical checks during clearing at the border inspection post Hamburg harbour between January 2014 and December 2015 with ISO standard methods. Quantitative results indicated that critical thresholds for aerobic counts, <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> were never surpassed. Merely for staphylococci, one poultry sample (0.2%) and 10 pork samples (9.3%) exceeded the critical limit (3.7 log cfu/g). However, qualitative analyses revealed that, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> was present in 16% and 10% of all poultry and pork samples, respectively, though no methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> could be confirmed. Moreover, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> was present in 50% and 67% of all pork and poultry samples, respectively, and thereof 33 isolates were confirmed as extended-spectrum &#x003b2;-lactamase-producing <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. Only 1.2% of the poultry samples were unacceptable due to the presence of <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp., whereas they were not detected in any pork sample. <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. were not detected in any sample. Though imported pork and poultry meat complies mostly with national market requirements, it might pose a potential risk to public health, especially for a direct or indirect foodborne transmission of imported, uncommon strains of zoonotic bacteria.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>German Ministry of Education and Research</institution></funding-source><award-id>FKZ 13N12697</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klein</surname><given-names>G&#x000fc;nter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the research program for civil security: security of food and the food chain (ZooGloW, project FKZ 13N12697) to GK.

Consequently, import of products of animal origin (POAO) into the EU MS from non-EU countries underlies specific conditions and rules. Regarding trading partners abroad, non-EU countries as well as the single food business operator within the respective country must be authorised for the introduction of a specific category of POAO into the EU, fulfilling all community requirements. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/output/non_eu_listsPerActivity_en.htm">Approved non-EU countries</ext-link> authorised for the introduction of meat are listed officially in accordance with all legal requirements [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. During clearance of consignments at EU entry points, official veterinarians at designated EU border inspection posts (BIP) therefore check all documentation and the identity of every single consignment arriving for legal compliance before these enter the EU territory. The frequency of physical checks depends on the risk profile of the product and also on the results of previous checks. In particular, physical checks are mandatory for at least 20% of consignments containing fresh meat and meat products (including offal of bovine, ovine, caprine, porcine and equine species) and 50% of poultry meat and poultry meat products [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Consignments found not to be compliant with Community legislation shall be rejected at all EU BIPs.</p><p>In recent years, notifications on these border rejections have been increasing exponentially, particularly due to high detection rates of <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. in consignments of poultry meat and products thereof, whereas red meat consignments such as pork and beef are most often rejected due to findings of shiga-toxin-producing <italic>Escherichia</italic> (<italic>E</italic>.) <italic>coli</italic> (STEC) [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, those microbiological analyses are not performed systematically. The strict preconditions for legal imports specified by the supranational authorities are rather performed risk-based, either on suspicious consignments or under the umbrella of the Multi Annual National Control Plan (MANCP). They cover feed and food, animal health and animal welfare controls in each MS [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, studies on the microbial quality and safety of legally imported pork and poultry meat into the EU are exceptional and most often focused on the detection of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Zogg et al. [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], reported that 100% and 66.7% of imported poultry meat from Argentina (n = 2) and Brazil (n = 3) at retail in Switzerland harboured extended &#x003b2;-lactamase (ESBL)-producing <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, but methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> (<italic>S</italic>.) <italic>aureus</italic> (MRSA) were only detected in EU-produced meat. Egerv&#x000e4;rn et al. [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported ESBL or transferable AmpC beta-lactamase (pAmpC)-producing <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> at a high prevalence (95%) in poultry meat imported predominantly from Brazil (n = 40), but also from Argentina and Chile (n = 3) to Sweden.</p><p>Despite the lack of scientific publications, those baseline data are essential parts of risk analyses and crucial for food safety authorities to reassure and verify veterinary standards on food quality and safety. Import risk analysis has been implemented mandatorily by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) by means of its sanitary and phytosanitary measures agreement (SPS Agreement). To avoid unjustified barriers to trade, imported products have to be treated non-discriminatorily and not less favourably than domestically-produced goods. The SPS Agreement dictates that all measures must be scientifically based and not unnecessarily restrictive. This requires improved surveillance and monitoring systems, risk analysis capabilities and quality assurance, and lastly adequate laboratory investigations of imported products [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the present paper is the first attempt to describe baseline microbial metrics of a large, representative sample size of legally imported fresh pork and poultry meat and salted meat preparations. We explored the prevalence of major food safety metrics such as <italic>Salmonella</italic>, <italic>Campylobacter</italic> and <italic>Yersinia</italic> but as well quality criteria such as the total aerobic mesophilic bacteria count, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, and staphylococci. In addition, the prevalence of ESBL-producing <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and MRSA were screened.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Sampling</title><p>In 2014 and 2015, the BIP Hamburg harbour received a total of 260 and 310 consignments of fresh poultry meat and 1,629 and 1,518 poultry meat preparations, respectively. In contrast, fresh pork consignments amounted for only 85 consignments in 2014 and 96 in 2015. All consignments were, however, cleared and subjected to the obligatory physical control check [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. During these physical checks in the BIP laboratory, a minimum of 250g per consignment was taken aseptically and stored at -18&#x000b0;C in labelled and sealed plastic bags to ensure traceability. The frozen samples were transferred quarterly to the Institute of Food Quality and Food Safety, Hannover (Germany) for further analyses. All samples were kept frozen at -18&#x000b0;C during storage and transport. In total, n = 718 poultry and n = 20 pork samples were collected by the competent authorities at the BIP Hamburg harbour in the years 2014 and 2015.</p><p>Only fresh meat and salted meat preparations (poultry breast and leg meat without any other seasoning, additives or ingredients) were considered suitable for microbiological analyses. Fresh meat was defined as meat that has not undergone any preserving process other than chilling, freezing or quick-freezing, including meat that was vacuum-wrapped or wrapped under a controlled atmosphere. Meat preparations were defined as uncooked fresh meat, including meat that has been reduced to fragments, which has had foodstuffs, seasonings, or additives added to it or which has undergone processes insufficient to modify internal muscle fibre structure of the meat and therefore eliminate the characteristics of fresh meat [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In order to increase the pork sample size, we included n = 119 commercially available Chilean frozen, boneless pork filets from a major German cash-and-carry wholesaler located in Hannover (Germany). The pork filets had been cleared via the BIP Hamburg Harbour but were not subjected to physical control.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Microbiological analysis</title><p>A subset of 516 poultry meat and 136 pork samples were subjected to microbiological analyses.

The ACC is a general microbiological indicator for food quality, particularly for the maintenance of the cold chain as the ACC represents the total amount (cfu) of mesophilic microorganisms. We received only frozen samples, and due to the satisfactory results, we can conclude that the storage during transport was in accordance with the legal regulations. Only smaller percentages, 9.6%, 7.4% and 13.4% of all pork filets surpassed the satisfactory target value for <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and staphylococci, respectively. <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> are indicators of water or food quality and their presence may be an indication of unhygienic processing condition. In our study, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> was the most frequent microbial contamination detected on poultry in 67% and on pork in 50% of all samples. Pathogenic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> usually lead to gastro-intestinal symptoms including fever, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. In particular, shiga-toxin-producing entero-pathogenic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli (</italic>STEC) harbour the potential to cause serious harm to consumers as an infection can lead to the haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans, kidney failure and may be fatal. EFSA reported, in 2015, a total of 15 positive samples from 296 single samples and 12 batches (4.9%). In addition, a total of 84 samples from turkey meat and 609 from broiler meat were tested with only five STEC O157-positive samples (0.8%) in broilers [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Even though we did not test for the major STEC virulence genes <italic>stx</italic> and <italic>eae</italic>, the high proportion of contaminating <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> in our samples indicates a poor hygiene status and a possible infection source. Whilst microbiological contamination and other hazards are omnipresent in meat, culinary tradition in Europe includes the consumption of undercooked meat such as pork filet and raw meat products, e.g. short ripened pork sausages, posing a considerable public health risk. Contaminated carcasses may play an important role in the direct and indirect transmission of zoonotic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. Moreover, ESBL-producing <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> constitute an additional concern since the initial treatment of invasive infections with these isolates is often inappropriate, resulting in an increased mortality rate in affected patients [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It was shown that EU meat imports might harbour various <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strains different from those commonly known in Europe. Particularly broiler meat from South America with a prevalence of 95% (38/40 samples) ESBL/AmpC-producing <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> was considered as a potential source to human exposure [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

High contamination of food with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> is generally due to improper personal hygiene during handling and processing. A further analysis on staphylococcal toxins of all encountered strains would have been necessary to assess the food safety risk of these samples, but laid beyond the designated framework of this study. Bacterial toxins, including those from <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp., were the third most frequent cause for foodborne outbreaks in the EU in 2013 [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Moreover, the contamination with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> poses an additional risk for consumers, being present in 16% of poultry and 10% of all pork samples of our study. Molecular analyses of this subset in the course of a subsequent study revealed the presence of genes encoding important virulence factors, such as the toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and different enterotoxins [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

In accordance with the DGHM criteria, <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. must be absent in a 25g sample of the product when placed on the market and also during shelf life. In our study, neither pork nor turkey meat, but 1.2% (n = 6) of individual chicken meat samples were classified as unacceptable due to the presence of <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. This is much less than in domestic products. EFSA reported non-compliance in domestic broiler meat due to <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. in 6.5% of the 16,981 units tested in 2015.

The overall proportion of <italic>Salmonella</italic>-positive broiler meat samples at retail was 7.4%, which was higher than at the slaughterhouse (6.3%) and at the processing plant (6.7%) levels. Moreover, EU MS tested a total of 47,038 units of fresh pig meat in 2015, of which 1.7% were <italic>Salmonella</italic>-positive, mainly at slaughterhouse level.

In our study, four <italic>Salmonella</italic>-positive samples originated from Brazil and two from Thailand. A study from Brazil, the principal exporter of broiler meat to the EU, reported a mean prevalence of <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. of 2.7% (range 0.0%-8.9%), primarily found in the State of S&#x000e3;o Paulo (50.6% of positive samples). The data originated from the period from September 2004 to July 2006, when 2,679 frozen chicken carcasses at retail from 15 Brazilian cities were examined [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, it should be noted that the EU domestic poultry market offers basically chilled products only [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], whereas freezing and the long storage time below -18&#x000b0;C induces in <italic>Salmonella</italic> a viable but not-culturable (VNBC) state, in which they remain or regain their virulence but are not detectable with classic cultural methods [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This may contribute to our low detection rates.</p><p>Furthermore, we did not detect any <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp., even though broiler meat is considered as the most important single source of human campylobacteriosis. In 2015, a high (46.7% of 6,707 tested units) prevalence of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. in EU domestic fresh broiler meat was reported by 14 MS in samples at slaughter, processing and retail, including single and batch samples from all sampling stages [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

Imports are expected to grow gradually from 2013 to 2014, approaching 1 million t by 2025, as a consequence of increased production in two of the EU&#x02019;s main supplier countries, Thailand and Brazil [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Undoubtedly, trade flows depend strongly on long-established trade relations, most favourable shipping routes, and waterways. For example, poultry imports to Germany mainly originate from Brazil, while Chile is the major trading partner of the United Kingdom [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, the EU import quantities of pork accounted for 17 to 20 thousand tonnes in the past decade and are expected to remain within the range of 20 thousand t in the coming years [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The EU pork trade is restricted to only four countries, namely Australia, Chile, Canada and the United States of America. All pork filets in our study were of Chilean origin. This mirrors recent import activities; only 3,200 t pork were imported to Germany in 2014, mainly from Chile. In particular, Chilean pork imports even dropped to 2,000 t (-27%) compared to 2013. Moreover, pork import quantities remain negligible as the European pork market is currently oversaturated with a self-sufficiency of 111% of the inner-EU production [<xref rid="pone.0192550.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, these changes in EU pork consumption patterns may limit domestic demand and in particular the concerns of import from non-European countries may aggravate the trade situation. This situation was also reflected in difficulties in obtaining a sufficient sample size in the course of the present study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Conclusions</title><p>International trade improves the global availability of products of animal origin but enables foodborne zoonotic and multi-resistant bacteria to spread worldwide. Trade agreements and legal regulations on the import of products of animal origin are well implemented and provide the highest level of food safety for the EU consumers. Therefore, all imports of fresh meat and meat products into the European Union are subject to veterinary certification, but microbial analyses thereof are rare. We confirm that only minor quantities of poultry meat are unacceptable due to microbiological contamination, whereas pork does surpass legal thresholds to a considerable amount. Even though the vast majority of imported consignments comply with market requirements, imported poultry and pork might pose a potential risk to public health for a direct or indirect foodborne transmission of zoonotic bacteria, and in particular those resistant to antimicrobials, due to the consumption of and cross-contamination with raw or undercooked meat.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Silke Ortaeri for expert technical assistance and Ga&#x000eb;l Bertrand for the excellent technical support in data visualisation.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0192550.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><collab>European Commission</collab>. <chapter-title>Share of EU in the World Trade</chapter-title>
