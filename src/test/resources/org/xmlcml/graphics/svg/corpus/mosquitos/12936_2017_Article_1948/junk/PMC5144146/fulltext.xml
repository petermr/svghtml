South American camelids were even found on remote and hard to reach islands, emphasizing their importance to historic and pre-historic South American populations. Isla Mocha, a volcanic island 35&#x02009;km offshore of Central-South Chile, is an example of such an island. When Dutch and Spanish explorers reached the island in the early 17th century, they found that domesticated camelids called &#x0201c;<italic>chilihueque</italic>&#x0201d; played a major role in the island&#x02019;s society. The origin and taxonomy of these enigmatic camelids is unclear and controversial. This study aims to resolve this controversy through genetic analyses of Isla Mocha camelid remains dating from pre-Columbian to early historic times. A recent archaeological excavation of site P21-3 on Isla Mocha yielded a number of camelid remains. Three complete mitochondrial genomes were successfully recovered and analysed. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that &#x0201c;<italic>chilihueque</italic>&#x0201d; was a local term for a domesticated guanaco. Results from phylogeographic analyses are consistent with Isla Mocha camelids being sourced from Southern Chilean guanaco populations. Our data highlights the capability of ancient DNA to answer questions about extinct populations which includes species identity, potential translocation events and origins of founding individuals.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The translocation of animals to islands has been an important human adaptive strategy even before the development of domestication<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Live animals are transported for numerous reasons including as future food resources, for their by-products, which can include bones, teeth, fibre, or dung, or for their cultural/spiritual or ritual importance. Often sizable challenges and obstacles had to be overcome to transport larger animals across considerable water gaps, emphasizing the cultural importance of these translocated animals. The enigmatic camelids of Isla Mocha, an island located approximately 35&#x02009;km off the coast in the Arauco region of South Central Chile, are an example of such a challenging translocation of animals.</p><p>Isla Mocha has not been connected to the mainland since it rose above sea level during the Pleistocene, and it has no native large land mammals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The earliest human occupation of the island is dated to about 3500 years ago and evidence of permanent occupation dates from about 1500 years ago<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Archaeological excavations on Isla Mocha have provided a large number of bone artifacts made of large mammal bones such as cetaceans, pinnipeds and camelids. Camelid bones make up the majority of the mammal remains in archaeological sites on the island. The large numbers of camelid remains present in archaeological sites on Isla Mocha suggest animals were likely living there from the time of permanent occupation. It is generally accepted that they were culturally important, used for ritual sacrifice, with the meat only consumed on special occasions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Thus, live animals had to be translocated from the mainland to the island. The 35&#x02009;km crossing from the mainland to Isla Mocha is a dangerous one, particularly in the winter time. Modern kayakers claim that the crossing from Tirua, the closest launching site on the mainland, to the island takes approximately 7&#x02009;hours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Transporting live camelids to Isla Mocha would have been particularly difficult and thus may have been a rare occurrence.</p><p>The origin and taxonomy of the Mocha camelids has been a matter of debate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Early European descriptions of the island&#x02019;s resources, including that of van Speilbergen in 1615, describe the presence of sheep or odd looking camel like creatures: &#x0201c;sheep of a very wonderful shape, having a very long neck and a hump like a camel, a hare lip and very long legs&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. These animals were referred to as &#x0201c;<italic>chilihueque</italic>&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>Today, South American camelids are classified as belonging to four species within two genera, the wild forms, guanaco (<italic>Lama guanicoe</italic>) and vicu&#x000f1;a (<italic>Vicugna vicugna</italic>), and the domestic species, llama (<italic>L. glama</italic>), and alpaca (<italic>V. pacos</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. How &#x0201c;<italic>chilihueques</italic>&#x0201d; fit into this taxonomy is unclear. Bonacic (1991) described them as a group of camelids that existed during Pre-Hispanic and early colonial times in central and south-central Chile, which went extinct during the 16th or 17th century, likely due to the arrival of the European horse and sheep<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The author suggested that &#x0201c;<italic>chilihueque&#x0201d;</italic> was either a local name for a different form of the llama that was brought down from Northern Chile or that &#x0201c;chilihueques&#x0201d; were a sub-species of locally domesticated guanaco<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Gay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, on the other hand, referred to &#x0201c;chilihueque&#x0201d; simply as the Mapuche name for a domesticated guanaco without describing them as a separate taxonomic unit.</p><p>Here we use next generation sequencing technology coupled with DNA bait capture enrichment to obtain complete mitochondrial genomes of camelid remains recovered from archaeological excavations on Isla Mocha in order to identify the camelid species translocated to Isla Mocha and locate the likely origin of the potential source population.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>DNA preservation, recovery and authenticity</title><p>A total of 14 samples were excavated and DNA was extracted from all samples. Ion Torrent sequencing libraries were prepared from all sample DNA extracts alongside three extraction blanks and a library preparation blank. All libraries including blank libraries were quantified using quantitative PCR with Ion Torrent adapter specific primers and checked for the presence of adapter dimers on an agarose gel. Of the 14 excavated samples from Isla Mocha, six samples yielded sequenceable libraries free of adapter dimers and of those, three libraries successfully recovered nearly complete camelid mitochondrial genome data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). All blanks produced alongside the successfully sequenced samples Mocha04, Mocha05, Mocha06 showed no detectable PCR products when amplified with a camelid specific primer test set targeting a 60&#x02009;bp fragment of the camelid mitochondrial control region.</p><p>To further evaluate the authenticity of the obtained DNA sequence data, we inspected sequencing reads for characteristic deamination damage. The analysis with mapDamage showed damage patterns indicative of ancient DNA with the presence of increased C&#x02013;T and G&#x02013;A mutations at the respective 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of sequenced molecules (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). The average fragment length was 85&#x02013;100&#x02009;bp and therefore rather short, also consistent with ancient DNA (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p>Ion Torrent sequencing reads from each sequencing library were mapped against both a <italic>L. guanicoe</italic> and a <italic>V. vicugna</italic> reference mitochondrial genome to identify potential ascertainment bias.

Bayesian phylogenetic analyses, using the complete mitochondrial genomes of three ancient camelids grouped these individuals with modern <italic>L. guanicoe</italic>, to the exclusion of <italic>Vicugna vicugna, Lama glama</italic> and <italic>Vicugna pacos</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). These results are consistent with previous analyses based on morphological data, which also identified the Isla Mocha camelids as guanacos<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p><p>Identifying the exact geographic location of the source population of the Isla Mocha guanacos is challenging. Very limited complete mitochondrial data from guanaco populations from across South America is available to date. The only large-scale phylogeographic information for guanacos was based on the mitochondrial control region only<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Mar&#x000ed;n <italic>et al</italic>. discovered limited phylogeographic structure of guanacos across their range, but did find a well-defined separation between northern populations from Peru, Bolivia and Northern Chile and southern populations from Argentina and southern Chile. The only exception from this structure is one isolated population in the highlands of Bolivia, which groups with the southern haplotypes. The three Isla Mocha individuals sequenced in this study had unique and previously unsequenced haplotypes, but did group most closely with the southern populations.</p><p>These results suggest that the Isla Mocha camelids were most likely derived from southern South American guanaco populations rather than llamas brought in from the North, as suggested by the alternative hypothesis. The very limited phylogeographic structure of southern South American guanacos prevents a more precise determination of the geographic origins of the Isla Mocha camelids.</p><p>Together with morphological studies, our data provides some insights into the taxonomic status of the enigmatic &#x0201c;<italic>chilihueques&#x0201d;</italic> from Isla Mocha. All pre-historic and early historic camelid remains from Isla Mocha studied so far have been described as guanacos based on morphological evidence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Similarly, our genetic data group the three individuals studied by us with guanacos. While the haplotypes of our samples are unique, they do not form a monophyletic clade within the guanaco diversity as could for example be expected from a reproductively isolated subspecies. We therefore suggest that &#x0201c;<italic>chilihueque&#x0201d;</italic> was merely a local term for a guanaco. Whether or not the term &#x0201c;<italic>chilihueque&#x0201d;</italic> was specifically referring to domesticated guanacos, as suggested by Gay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, cannot be inferred from our limited genetic data or the island&#x02019;s archaeology and remains a contentious question<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. It is conceivable that the animals were transported to the island and released for hunting or that they were casually managed rather than fully domesticated.</p><p>Our data provide the first glimpse into the origin and taxonomy of the enigmatic Isla Mocha camelids or &#x0201c;c<italic>hilihueques&#x0201d;</italic>, reinforcing the hypothesis that these camelids were guanacos derived from local mainland populations rather than domesticated llama populations brought in from further north. This result suggests a local sourcing of animals for translocation to the isolated Isla Mocha.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><p>In 2011, an archaeological excavation was undertaken on Mocha at site P21&#x02013;3 located on Parcela 21 on the southwest site of the island. The site is located on a marine terrace approximately 20&#x02013;30&#x02009;m above sea level. Two units, 100 and 100a were identified. A total of 10&#x02009;m<sup>3</sup> was excavated in unit 100a and total of 6.4&#x02009;m<sup>3</sup> in unit 100. Excavations followed the natural stratigraphy of the sites. An area of 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4 metres was excavated to a depth of 2&#x02009;meters, in approximately 10&#x02009;cm spits. P21-3 is believed to be an occupation site and midden linked to P21-1, a burial site located approximately 20 metres away and excavated in 2001 and 2003 by Daniel Quiroz and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. The P21-3 site contains evidence of continuous human occupation for at least 1,000 years. A number of intact cultural deposits containing a large amount of faunal, ceramic and lithic material from throughout the El Vergel complex (dating to 1,000&#x02013;1,500 AD) and into the Pitren occupation period (0&#x02013;600 AD) provide evidence for occupation over this time. Faunal remains recovered included fish, marine mammals, camelids, rodents, canids, and bird bones (unpublished data). The sequenced camelid remains were recovered from archaeological contexts at P21-3, with associated material dating from 689 +/&#x02212; 31 BP to 134 +/&#x02212; 20 BP (Wk 38379&#x02013;38395). A total of 14 camelid samples were considered appropriate for ancient DNA analysis and were bagged and labeled for such purposes at the site.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>DNA extractions</title><p>All ancient DNA extractions and sequencing library preparations were undertaken in a dedicated ancient DNA laboratory, at the University of Otago, Dunedin. 250&#x02009;mg of bone material per sample was ground to a powder using a clean mortar and pestle then subsequently extracted using a silica based extraction protocol modified from Rohland and Hofreiter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. For every five samples extracted, one extraction blank was also processed under the same conditions. Three microliter aliquots of extraction blanks were amplified with a primer set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), based on sequences from Mar&#x000ed;n <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, targeting a 60&#x02009;bp fragment of the camelid mitochondrial control region to detect the presence of camelid DNA in extractions and blanks. The following thermal profile was used for this amplification: Initial denaturation step of 94&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for nine minutes followed by 40 steps of 94&#x02009;&#x000b0;C denaturation for 20&#x02009;seconds, 55&#x02009;&#x000b0;C annealing for 30&#x02009;seconds, and 72&#x02009;&#x000b0;C elongation for 30&#x02009;seconds then a final elongation of 72&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 4&#x02009;minutes and storage at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.

Subsequent to library preparation, barcoded libraries were PCR amplified to produce easy to store stock libraries while at the same time retaining maximum library complexity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. To reduce amplification artifacts, the PCR was stopped after amplification plateau was reached, as determined by quantitative PCR.</p><p>Agarose gel electrophoresis (2.5% gel) of amplified libraries was used to visually check the success of the library preparation and to identify the presence of adapter dimers. Libraries with strong adapter dimers were excluded from sequencing as they strongly reduce the reads on target in a sequencing run. Only libraries that showed a characteristic smear of expected size (c. 150&#x02013;300&#x02009;bp) and no adapter dimer bands were used for downstream analyses. To check for potential cross contamination, no-template control libraries were PCR amplified with the same 60&#x02009;bp camelid control region specific primers and the same thermal profile used to test for contamination of the extraction blanks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).
