The parsimonious explanation for absent population recovery is high prevalence of osteopathology as evidenced earlier in carcasses, and now by these clinical cases. Areas currently used by huemul have reduced selenium bioavailability, very deficient soil levels, and overt selenium deficiency in local livestock and plants. These areas are known to result in primary iodine deficiency which is aggravated by selenium deficiency. The nexus to nutritional ecology of huemul likely is inaccessibility to most fertile lowlands and traditional winter ranges, elimination of migratory traditions, and concomitant elimination of source populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13104-017-3052-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Huemul</kwd><kwd>Hippocamelus bisulcus</kwd><kwd>Trace mineral deficiency</kwd><kwd>Selenium</kwd><kwd>Iodine</kwd><kwd>Osteopathology</kwd><kwd>Acute periodontitis</kwd><kwd>Parodontitis</kwd><kwd>Lack of recovery</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par4">Patagonian huemul deer (<italic>Hippocamelus bisulcus</italic>) have been considered endangered for over a century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], numbers continue declining, and possibly only 1500 individuals remain. Numbers and occupied areas likely began to decline with pre-Columbian humans, and earliest accounts about huemul from interior Patagonia described landscapes already modified for several 100 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In Argentina, only 350&#x02013;500 huemul remain, split into some 50 subpopulations, and knowledge is rudimentary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], as tools like telemetry have only recently been employed. Skeletal remains collected between 1993&#x02013;2007 provided data on bone disease and demonstrated its potential to contribute to morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]: osteopathy among adults was at least 57%, with affected individuals having mandibular (63%), maxillary (100%), and appendicular lesions (78%). These lesions would affect predator avoidance, possibly explaining the low average adult age (3.1&#x000a0;years) and lack of population recovery. Primary etiologic factors discarded were senescence, gender, fulminating infections, congenital anomalies, parasitism or marasmus, fluorosis, and disorders of metabolic, endocrine, genetic, or neurologic origins. Instead, secondary chronic alveolar osteomyelitis and osteoarthritis were hypothesized to relate to nutritional ecology of huemul. Selenium (Se) deficiency, which impairs bone metabolism and causes periodontitis in ruminants, occurs regionally and is more prevalent at high altitudes where extant huemul tend to remain. This was recently corroborated in Chilean huemul, which were also afflicted with such osteopathology, and severe Se deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The presented novel data about types and prevalence of osteopathology in live huemul extends previously documented postmortem cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and furthermore lends imperative support for the hitherto hypothesized causal relationship between nutritional constraints as factors which have prevented the recovery of most of the &#x0003e;&#x000a0;100 fragmented subpopulations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Main text</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par5">The study area (44&#x000b0;51&#x02032;S, 71&#x000b0;48&#x02032;W) has two lakes (167&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup>) surrounded by the Andes mountains, peaking 1900&#x000a0;m or higher (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1).

Additionally, a female found soon after death was necropsied.

One male was strongly limping while another male had a damaged hoof. Four animals lost 2&#x02013;7 front teeth, with roots of remaining teeth exposed from gum recession: yet the oldest age was only 4&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years. One animal had abnormally wide gaps between incisors and exposed roots from gum recession. A female with 4 lost front teeth and exposed roots exhibited severe bone necrosis, very loose teeth both in mandible and maxilla, and the mandibular body showing a massive perforation. These cases of acute periodontitis and parodontitis undoubtedly explain the poor level of fat deposits in the dead female, and advanced muscle atrophy in the male which had lost 7 frontal teeth. These lesions, their severity and prevalence, corroborate previous observations on 35 skeletons of Patagonian huemul deer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The high prevalence of osteopathology in carcasses is now also substantiated for live huemul. The clinical severity of osteopathology in carcasses from Argentina (this study, 2) and Chile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] demonstrate the severity of the disease status of these recently radio-collared huemul.</p><p id="Par17">An important new discovery is that 57% of huemul had lost 2&#x02013;7 front teeth in vivo even at young age, suggesting strong osteopathological processes resulting in age-independent premature exfoliation of teeth. Incisors were unmentioned in earlier analyses of carcasses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], being commonly absent in decomposed jaws, since single conical roots have little hold in the alveoli.</p><p id="Par18">Given the fresh dead huemul had not only lost incisors, but also exhibited severe mandibular and maxillary lesions, the other diseased but live individuals most certainly have similar additional lesions. These exfoliated front teeth resemble periodontosis (&#x0201c;broken-mouth&#x0201d;) described in sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], except that symptoms in huemul also include lesions of premolars and molars, and affected young individuals. Observations of additional huemul at close distances revealed asymmetrical velvet growth and lumps beneath mandibles: therefore, likely other cases affected by clinical disease. Reduced foraging efficiency via exfoliated incisive teeth presents the most parsimonious explanation for observed impacts on body condition, low average age of 3.1&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and recruitment rates too low to allow re-colonization of habitats used historically.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Etiological factors</title><p id="Par19">In case of accompanying infections, it is fundamental to determine if they are of primary versus secondary origin. Fluorosis was discarded for Argentine huemul [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, iodine deficiency in southern Chile is documented in people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and livestock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In two Argentine provinces with huemul, goiter rates in 1965 among 20&#x000a0;year-old men were 33 and 48% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Primary iodine deficiency thus may also affect huemul, but is aggravated by Se deficiency due to its key function in iodine metabolism. Se deficiency in huemul has been confirmed in southern Chile, with 73% deficient and 64% severely deficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], coinciding with Se deficient plants and livestock, including severe muscular dystrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Soil Se levels (0.19&#x000a0;ppm) from areas used by extant huemul, shown to be at the <italic>low end</italic> of the range considered deficient, corroborate deficient levels in forage, livestock and huemul [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Moreover, the nexus between osteopathology in huemul and nutritional factors has been shown for a population in Chile: co-occurrent Se deficiency and severe degree of equivalent bone lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Mammalian biochemistry (Se, iodine) allows direct extrapolations between species with high degrees of correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], because Se functions at very basic biochemical levels including genetic coding: being the 21st naturally occurring amino acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Se deficiency not only reduces host defense, but also impairs bone metabolism, causing osteopenia and osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Similar environments elsewhere cause Se deficiency in ruminants, documented as underlying factor for periodontitis, mandibular thickening, premature tooth exfoliation, and reduced bone density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], similarly to lesions in huemul here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and from Chile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Se is essential in thyroid metabolism, and thus plays a major role in iodine deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The combined known effects on bone metabolism present the most intelligible explanation for the osteopathology and lack of recovery. Importantly, Se and iodine deficiency also have a strong direct impact on reproduction, and thus on recruitment and potential to colonize new areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Aspect of nutritional ecology</title><p id="Par21">Commonly, mammals have strong presence in good habitat (source areas), but they also occupy marginal areas, and even areas incapable of sustaining populations (sink areas). Most remaining huemul subpopulations (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;100) fail to recover, are diminishing, or have recently disappeared, indicating these habitats are not good enough as source areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although environments with extant huemul contain highly heterogeneous landscapes due to topography, it remains a crucial fact that huemul are currently only using very restricted portions, which tend to be marginal or deficient regarding micronutrients. However, huemul formerly also utilized more fertile landscape portions, particularly during winter, namely places which became occupied with humans, their agriculture and livestock, or with towns and cities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Several trace minerals like Se are consistently more concentrated in lower elevations in flood plains, valley bottoms, and in drier sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Moreover, geological processes frequently result in mineral licks used by wild ruminants, and these occur most often, even exclusively, on winter ranges and at low elevations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Other wild ruminants make short trips during summer, to visit mineral licks every other months on winter ranges up to 2000&#x000a0;m lower in elevation, to replenish Se-deficient summer diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In the Columbian Andes, ruminants were Se deficient at high, but not at low elevation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Yet the existing absence of recovery of huemul must not be an enigma. The nexus to nutritional ecology regarding huemul likely is their inaccessibility of most lowlands and traditional winter ranges, elimination of their migratory traditions, and concomitant elimination of source populations. Thus, remaining huemul populations are frequently restrained to marginal if not sink areas, or ecological traps. Moreover, subclinical effects may be the more frequent situation, yet these are best demonstrated mainly with production trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. One remedy is the use of adaptive management by creating source population via breeding centers and reintroducing these huemul to formerly used habitat, which are considered to provide the necessary conditions to form source populations.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par24">The presented data is limited by sample size and by itself does not allow generalizations outside of the study area.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>
