the gallbladder and biliary ducts. The problem is most acute in the southern provinces.
These areas constitute the low average income associated with low educational attainment
and a high rate of obesity compared with the rest of Chile. We could also include genetic
factors related to processes of lithogenesis to these elements which are more common among
the Mapuche. This population sub-group could benefit from special government programmes
for early diagnosis and treatment of lithiasic disease and for the management of risk
factors such as obesity. In this way, we could reduce the mortality rate of gallbladder
cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>gallbladder</kwd><kwd>biliary tract</kwd><kwd>Chile</kwd><kwd>epidemiology</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>Mapuche</kwd><kwd>ethnicity</kwd><kwd>cholelithiasis</kwd><kwd>socioeconomy</kwd><kwd>education</kwd><kwd>income</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer of the gallbladder is one of the most common types of neoplastic disease among the
Chilean population. It is associated with a high rate of mortality, and the net result is
years of life lost owing to incapacity and premature death.</p><p>The demographic distribution within the national territory is heterogeneous and related to
the socio-cultural and economic conditions of the different regions. It is also associated
with the presence of risk factors in which cholelithiasis is the most important of all.</p></sec><sec><title>Material</title><p>We reviewed data from the Department of Health Statistics and Information (DEIS) for the
years 2000&#x02013;2013 as well as data available in the First Cancer Register of Chile for
2003&#x02013;2007 [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. We also reviewed data projected by the International Agency Research
Cancer (IARC) on their page Globocan 2012 in order to compare the data available in Chile
with other countries [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The global picture of gallbladder cancer</title><p>For 2012, Globocan recorded a global rate of 178,801 new cases of gallbladder cancer and
142,823 deaths. The age-adjusted rate of incidence (ARI) was 2.2 for every 100,000 people,
while the age-adjusted rate of mortality (ARM) was 1.7 for every 100,000 [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The greatest concentration of incidents and deaths occurs in the least developed regions
of the world. Within these zones, the Western Pacific region shows the highest
age-adjusted rate of incidence, which reaches 3.1 per 100,000 inhabitants, and an
age-adjusted rate of mortality of 2.5 per 100,000 inhabitants.</p><p>Chile is the world leader, with incidence figures of 9.7 new cases for every 100,000
inhabitants each year, followed by Bolivia (8.1 per 100,000 inhabitants), South Korea (6.5
per 100,000 inhabitants), Laos (4.7 per 100,000 inhabitants), and Japan (4.7 per 100,000
inhabitants).</p><p>The ranking with respect to mortality figures is similar. Chile sits in first place with
a ARM of 7.8 or 7.6, according to figures from DEIS [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], per 100,000 inhabitants, followed by Bolivia (7.5 per 100,000 inhabitants),
South Korea (4.8 per 100,000 inhabitants), Laos (4.8 per 100,000 inhabitants), and Nepal
(4.1 per 100,000 inhabitants) [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The Chilean picture of gallbladder cancer</title><p>With respect to the incidences of gallbladder cancer in Chile, we only have local data
gathered in a few population registers of cancer. These registers were begun in 1998 by
health services in the regions of Antofagasta (Northern Chile) and Los R&#x000ed;os
(Southern Chile). These two registers along with those of Biob&#x000ed;o province are
integrated into the National Agency Research Cancer (IARC) database.</p><p>Drawing on these IARC population registers, the first report of Population Registers of
Cancer in Chile was published in 2012, which included cases of incidence of the disease
occurring between 2003&#x02013;2007 [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The ARI of all cancers in Chile was 226.7 per every 100,000 men and 179.3 per every
100,000 women during that period.</p><p>Cancers presenting the highest ARI in men were: prostate (61.3 per 100,000), stomach
(34.1 per 100,000), non-melanoma skin cancer (25.4 per 100,000), lung (19.7 per 100,000),
colon (10.8 per 100,000), and gallbladder and biliary duct (8.7 per 100,000).</p><p>Cancers with the highest ARI for women were: breast (43.2 per 100,000), non-melanoma skin
cancer (19.2 per 100,000), gallbladder and biliary duct (17.2 per 100,000), cervical (14.6
per 100,000), and stomach (12.8 per 100,000).</p><p>The rates of mortality for different cancers have undergone changes during the last
decades.</p><p>According to the figures submitted by DEIS for the year 2000, the ARM for cancer was
118.7 deaths for every 100,000 inhabitants, while in 2013 the rate rose more than 20
points to 139.5 per 100,000 subjects. This meant an increase from 18,273 to 24,592
deaths.</p><p>For the year 2000, 1,278 deaths related to gallbladder cancer were recorded (the rest of
the biliary duct is not included in these statistics), which indicates an ARM of 8.3 per
100,000 inhabitants. These figures have remained constant during the period, amounting to
7.6 deaths for every 100,000 inhabitants in 2013 or 1343 deaths for that year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>In 2000, cancer of the gallbladder was the third most common neoplastic disease leading
to death, after stomach and lung cancer. In 2013, it was in sixth place after stomach,
lung, colon, rectal, prostate, and breast cancer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Among men, the ARM for gallbladder cancer is in eighth place for the year 2000 with 3.8
deaths for every 100,000 men. In 2013, there was a decline in rank to tenth place but a
slight rise in the rate to 4.2 deaths per 100,000.</p><p>Among women, breast cancer was the most common cause of death from cancer in 2000,
followed by stomach, and then gallbladder in third place with 12.7 deaths per 100,000
women. In 2013, breast cancer was the most common cause of death from cancer in women,
while gallbladder cancer dropped to fourth place with an ARM of 11 deaths per 100,000.</p><p>The ARMs increase with age. For women, it increases after age 45, while it increases ten
years later in men i.e. from age 55 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure
2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Regional picture of gallbladder cancer</title><p>For cancer of the gallbladder and biliary duct, the regions that show the highest rate of
incidence in comparison with the rest of Chile include those from the O&#x02019;Higgins
region down to Ays&#x000e9;n; that is, from the central south of the country to the south.
Also included is the Coquimbo region located in the central north of the country. The
highest rates are found in the regions of Los Lagos and Los R&#x000ed;os (Southern Chile)
[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>For men, the regional picture for gallbladder and biliary duct cancer shows that the
greatest number of incidents occur in the area from Maule to Magallanes (central south and
south of the country) to which we can add the Atacama region. The highest rate was found
in Ays&#x000e9;n (Southern Chile) with 18.3 cases for every 100,000 men (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>For women, cancer of the gallbladder and biliary duct shows high rates of incidence in
the regions between and including O&#x02019;Higgins to Ays&#x000e9;n, to which we can add
Coquimbo. The highest ARI was found in the regions of Los Lagos and Los R&#x000ed;os, each
with 28.5 per 100,000 women (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The mortality data for 2013 from DEIS show that the southern provinces had the highest
rate of mortality for both men and women. The Los R&#x000ed;os region showed the highest
rate with 15.6 per 100,000 followed by the regions of Los Lagos, Ays&#x000e9;n and
Araucan&#x000ed;a [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>For men, the province with the highest ARM is Los R&#x000ed;os with 9.42, followed by Los
Lagos with 7.07, and Araucan&#x000ed;a with 6.9 per 100,000. For women, the highest rate is
found in Ays&#x000e9;n region with 22.09, followed by Los R&#x000ed;os with 20.65, Los Lagos
with 19.98, and Araucan&#x000ed;a with 15.61 per 100,000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Chile has the greatest rate of incidence and mortality of gallbladder cancer worldwide. In
order to explain this local reality, socioeconomic, environmental, and genetic factors that
influence the development of the disease must be considered.</p><p>With regard to the socioeconomic and cultural reality that the disease can entail, a study
of the population of Valdivia made between 1998 and 2000 evaluated the characteristics of
the population, incidence rates and survival of 317 patients with gallbladder cancer. It
showed that 64% of cases debuted in stage IV of the disease, and the incidence rates were
higher in women with Mapuche ancestry particularly older than age 50 and with a low level of
education (less than four years). These numbers rise to 269.2 new cases per 100,000 women
[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In 2015, Herrera published an article in which he calculated the specific mortality from
cancer adjusted for the educational level in the Chilean population. It showed that there is
a higher rate of most of the cancers that are present in the population that had the lowest
levels of education with the exception of breast cancer in women and lung cancer in men.
These differences are even more pronounced in the case of gallbladder cancer in women with
specific rates of mortality that are 49 times greater than those present in women with high
levels of education. Therefore, mortality from cancer in Chile is strongly associated with
the educational level of the population. This group could be more vulnerable to factors
associated with a greater incidence of cancer such as exposure to higher risk conduct such
as alcohol consumption, a lower level of physical activity, or a higher body mass index,
consultation delayed to later stages of the disease or differences in timely access to
treatment [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The regions in which the greatest incidences and mortalities are concentrated are also the
poorest regions or those with the lowest income per capita. The regions with the lowest
income, based on national account data provided by the central bank of Chile, were the
Araucania, the Los Lagos and the Los Rios regions according to the number of inhabitants who
live in them [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>When comparing the survival rates of the patients who were treated in different healthcare
establishments, whether in public hospitals or private ones, it was shown that the survival
rate is lower in the public hospitals of the south versus public hospitals and private
clinics in Santiago, Chile&#x02019;s capital. However, by making an adjustment for the stage
of the disease at the time of diagnosis, no differences were found in the survival rate
between the different hospitals. From this, it is concluded that the only predictor of
survival is the stage at which the disease presents at the time of the diagnosis. It is even
more crucial than access to infrastructure and cutting-edge treatment technology. For this
reason disease prevention takes on a greater importance than treatment techniques according
to the study [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Obesity is another risk factor. This can contribute to the development of gallbladder
cancer through its association with gallstones, its association with the increase of
endogenous estrogens, or its association with fat cells which have ability to secrete a
large amount of inflammatory mediators [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Chile is the country with the second highest rate of obesity in women (33.6%) after
Venezuela and is third for men (24.5%) after Argentina and Venezuela. At the global level,
Chile has a rate of prevalence near to or greater than even developed countries like the
United States and much higher than the United Kingdom and other emerging countries like
China [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The Chile National Health Survey 2009&#x02013;2010 showed an obesity trend in accordance
with educational level with a rate of 35.5% in the lower educational level and 18.5% in the
higher. Women who live in rural areas also have a higher prevalence. The highest rate of
prevalence of obesity is in the southern regions of Chile, especially the Los Rios region
and the Aysen region which are regions in which the incidence and mortality from gallbladder
cancer are higher than in the rest of the country [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Chilean studies have considered the population attributable fraction which is the
percentage of cases that can be avoided by eliminating exposure to the risk factor like
obesity as in this case. In the case of gallbladder cancer, this is 27% in women and 7% in
men. Strategies that target reducing obesity envisage a significant reduction in the
incidence of this type of cancer [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Gallbladder cancer is developed in the context of a chronic inflammation. In the majority
of patients, the source of this chronic inflammation is cholesterol stones. The presence of
stones increases the risk of gallbladder cancer four-to fivefold. Gallstones are reported in
79&#x02013;100% of the gallbladder cancers [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In the Chilean population, gallstones have a high degree of prevalence of up to 26.7%,
36.6% in women and 16.6% in men [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Ethnic
differences exist when comparing the Chilean general population with other ethnic groups
that live in the same country such as the Rapa Nui ethnic group in which gallstone frequency
is very low at 6.4% [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], whereas in the Mapuche
population, it is so high that it reaches up to 35% [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, only 7% of the non-cholecystectomised population had symptoms
compatible with gallstones, therefore it is possible to consider that most of the
gallbladder pathology would appear asymptomatically This also becomes a problem for the
early detection and surgical management of this condition which can lead to underestimating
the need for resources to treat this disease. A coverage study of cholecystectomy in Chile
showed that the populations that were subjected to more cholecystectomy surgeries were the
Aysen and the Los Lagos regions, where there would be a greater prevalence of gallstones
[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>A lithogenic gradient exists between ethnic groups. This was demonstrated in a study of the
mitochondrial DNA polymorphism of the Chilean population. An Amerindian maternal lineage was
shown in the 100% of Mapuches and in 88% of the Hispanic Chileans. The same haplotypes were
found in tribes in North and South America. The high prevalence of gallstones among
non-obese young Mapuche people and Pima Indians suggests the presence of high penetrating
lithogenic genes in these populations [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The
most studied lithogenic polymorphisms correspond to the ABCG8-DH19 transporter gene in the
ABCG5/G8 heterodimer pattern and that simultaneously could be related to a greater risk of
developing cancer in certain ethnic populations like in the Chinese population [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These genes would participate in the generation of
cholesterol stones, expressing abnormal molecular mechanisms in the secretion and/or
solubility of cholesterol that would be present in women and is influenced by environmental
factors like obesity [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The presence of gallstones is associated with inflammatory processes that could promote
early changes in TP53 through increased cell turnover and oxidative stress. The deactivation
of TP53 either by mutation or deletion is the most common genetic alteration in cancers and
is observed in early stages of the natural history of gallbladder cancer, even in
histologically normal epithelium. Exposure to environmental mutagens can also lead to
alteration of TP53 as is the case with aflatoxins. Multiple polymorphisms in genes
associated with the immune system, inflammation, and oxidative stress that have been linked
to the development of gallbladder cancer like PTGS2, TLR2, TLR4, IL1RN, IL10, IL8, CCR5,
LXRB, and OGG1. The use of some anti-inflammatories such as aspirin has been linked to a
reduction in the risk of gallbladder cancer [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Other more unusual causes of chronic inflammation are primary sclerosing cholangitis,
ulcerative colitis [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], chronic infection by
Salmonella typhi and paratyphi [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and infection
by Helicobacter pylori [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] which could have a
common endpoint in chronic injury of the large bile ducts with concentric periductal
fibrosis, inflammation, and obliteration.</p><p>However, chronic inflammation of the gallbladder is only one part of the cause of the
malignant transformation seen in gallbladder cancer. Many other factors have been identified
such as the ingestion of certain medications, particularly oral contraceptives and
methyldopa; exposure to certain chemical products, pesticides, rubbers, vinyl chloride;
occupational exposure associated with work with textiles, petroleum, the paper industry, and
the footwear industry. Added to these are exposure to pesticide-contaminated water, heavy
metals, and radiation [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. An association has also
been found between gallbladder cancer and the aflatoxins present in grain-based agriculture
as well as the ochratoxin A in red peppers. This association has been seen in the population
of Amerindian ancestry in Chile that consumes them frequently as well as in the Peruvian and
Bolivian population [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>An increase in the incidence of gallbladder cancer is seen in certain hereditary syndromes
such as Gardner syndrome, neurofibromatosis type I, and hereditary non-polypoid colon
cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Identification of the group most susceptible to developing gallbladder cancer is an
essential task in order to control the development of the disease, and also its incidence
and mortality. One identified group is the descendants of Mapuche origin or ancestry, and
they consitute mainly of women who live in the southern provinces of Chile. These population
must be educated about the disease and given access to screening and treatment for lithiasic
disease. Procedures must be started decades before the development of the cancer in order to
detect the at-risk population and subject them to cholecystectomy. Chile&#x02019;s programme
of explicit health guarantees has included cholecystectomy for patients with gallstones
between the ages of 35 and 49 since 2005. The impact of this intervention is likely to be
observed in the next decade depending on the degree of resolution and adherence to the
programme.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><collab>Datos recolectados de pagina del Departamento De Estad&#x000ed;sticas e
