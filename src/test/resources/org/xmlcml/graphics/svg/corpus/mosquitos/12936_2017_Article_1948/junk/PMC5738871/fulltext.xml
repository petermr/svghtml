epidemiology, carried out at a School of Nursing in Chile. The research subjects
consist of 17 nursing professors, with whom individual semi-structured interviews
were carried out and nine participated in a focus group. The Ethics Committee
approved this study. </p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>88.2% were female, mean age of 42 years, 47% were married, 94% were Chilean,
average length of service in the institution of 2.8 years, and 23.5% had a
master&#x02019;s degree. Regarding the work process, the students were the work object,
the tools used were the knowledge and the experience as a nurse, and the work
environment was considered good. Regarding the form of work organization, 76% have
a 44-hour workweek, the wage was considered inadequate and the workload was higher
than foreseen in the contract. The dialectic of the nursing work process is
evidenced, demonstrating the contradiction between the low wages and labor
overload and the narratives reporting a good work environment, personal
fulfillment and transcendence that goes far beyond work. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>the work process allows describing the work components of the nursing professors,
which are consistent with the results of the literature and show the dialectic of

always been people in need of health care, and care is understood as the essence of this
profession<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>, which evolved from an occupation without formal preparation to a profession
with training at higher education level. It can be developed in different areas, such as
administration, medical care, education, research and political participation, requiring
a set of specific skills and abilities for each of them<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. The nursing profession is inserted as a social practice in the world of work
and is marked by historical, social, economic and political events<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>. In the course of the nursing development process, world has been undergoing
significant changes due to globalization, and today, a capitalist mode of production has
caused many changes in the Work Process, which are also observed in the nursing work.
This has also meant changes in the profile of work and workers, which had to get adapted
to the new technologies and the current economic model<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>. Therefore, there is not only a need for professionals trained in the area of
knowledge, but also competent professionals with specific skills. In this fashion, there
is a need for professors with competencies in accordance with this new reality, as well
as significant changes in the teacher-student relationships<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>. In Latin America, Chilean society was also impacted by globalization, reflected
in the rapid growth of the population, changes in its structure, changes in the
morbidity and mortality profile, increase in life expectancy and improvements in living
and working conditions, such as food, wage, etc.<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>Because of the change in the Chilean economic model, there was an increase in the
university offer as a business possibility, generating an increase in the offer of
nursing training<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>, which, in turn became the most sought-after career at the national level. In
this context, there has been a rise in the number of nursing professionals who develop
their work process in the teaching area. The scenario in nursing teaching makes the work
process particularly complex, because training in nursing requires a specific
environment, and, in addition, in the teacher-student relationship there is also the
patient<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Work is a fundamental condition that sets out the position of individuals in society and
defines the power of consumption and access to decent living conditions<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>, representing more than just the relationship with employment or wages, but a
form of social insertion<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. In the health area, work is characterized by the provision of services,
consisting of provision of health care to individuals, and thus, being placed in the
tertiary sector of the countries&#x02019; economies. Understanding nursing as a career requires
the understanding of the health practices as social practices, which transcends the
professional and technical magnitude<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. At the same time, it is a dynamic practice that requires a constant review of
its components in the face of the changes in society and health care models<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>. Specifically in the teaching Work Process, the professional relationships are
differentiated and the teaching activities are performed in practice and, therefore,
there is a peculiarity in the way of experiencing the health-disease process<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>The Work Process consists of three elements: work object, work instruments and the work
itself<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>. Work object is where the activity being carried out will reach its effect and
that it will be transformed during the process to become a product<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>, so when this transformation process occurs in a person, as in the case of
Education, such a person is called subject of work<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. The work instrument is a set of tools that are in between the work itself and
the work object, serving as a means of its action on it<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>; and so the nursing professor transforms the work object (subject) using a
specific knowledge and appropriate tools<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. The activity refers to the work and the specific organization of the work for a
specific purpose<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>, as well as to working conditions, such as working hours, wage, institution&#x02019;s
schedule, hierarchy, among others<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>In order to understand work as a process, not only as a risk factor to people&#x02019;s lives,
an approach from a critical epidemiology point of view is necessary, considering that
epidemiological processes are active and defined in the social reproduction of each
group<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>Thus, according to the point of view of Naomar Almeida Filho, the main promoter of the
critical epidemiology in Brazil, it can be studied from both a qualitative and
quantitative perspectives, as long as its historical and social context is
maintained<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The changes in the labor market and the increase in the number of nursing professionals
dedicated to teaching in Chile have contributed to the growth of the role of nursing in
the teaching-learning process, as well as other areas of its competence. All of this
imposes the need to analyze the Work Process of nursing professors of a public
university, which is the objective of the present work.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>It is a descriptive, exploratory and qualitative study, developed with a focus on
critical epidemiology. The study scenario is the Nursing School of the University of
Chile, founded in 1906, which grants the title and the bachelor&#x02019;s degree in Nursing and
has been accredited for seven years (maximum grantable). In addition, it belongs to a
public university that stands out as a reference at national and international level.
The study population was composed of all nursing professors, totaling 52 people, by
applying the following selection criteria: 22, 33 or 44-hour workweek, work as a nursing
professor for six months or more. People on vacation or medical leave were excluded from
the study, resulting in 25 potential participating subjects. Individual interviews
coordinated by the main researcher, who had a prior work relationship with the
participants, were carried out with 17 nursing professors, through the application of a
questionnaire on sociodemographic data and the guiding question &#x0201c;How is your work
process as a nursing professor?&#x0201d;, which allowed the phenomenon to be understood by
researchers. Participants agreed to participate in the study (there were no withdrawals
or refusals to participate in the interviews) in a room at the School of Nursing with
total privacy, lasting between 15 and 32 minutes, in April 2014. In order to guide the
analysis process, interviews were recorded and transcribed in full. The data were
subjected to content analysis, considering predefined categories according to the Work
Process, object, instruments used, environment and form of organization. For data
presentation, the interviewees were identified using the letter E, and their numbers
were specified. The study was carried out according to the ethical requirements, being
approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of the
University of Chile, on January 21, 2014. The school administration also authorized the
study, and all subjects signed the Informed Consent Form. </p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In total, 17 nurses were interviewed. Regarding the sociodemographic characterization of
the population, the study shows that 88% of the subjects are female, mostly young
adults, 47% are married, 64.7% have children and 94% are Chilean. </p><p>Regarding the staff training, 100% of professors have postgraduate qualification
(<italic>lato sensu</italic>) of about 200 hours. Ten professors are currently
enrolled in a Master&#x02019;s program, three already have a Master&#x02019;s degree and four have not
yet started their postgraduate studies.</p><p>Regarding the work history, professors interviewed in the School of Nursing have, on
average, 2.8 years of service in the University, most of the participants work in the
institution between three and six years, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>. Workers have weekly working hours, so that 76.5% have a 44-hour
workweek, 17.6% have 33-hour workweek and 5.9% have a 22-hour workweek. With regard to
the type of contract of the professors, 52.9% take up the academic career within the
academic sector and 47.1% are engaged in the academic career as part of the
collaborative team. The second type of contract aims at protecting the remuneration of
the nursing professors, due to the lack of qualification on entering the academic
career. According to the academic hierarchy, 94.1% are classified as Instructors and
5.9% as Assistant Professors, with these being the two hierarchies present in the School
of Nursing under study. In addition, the interviewed nursing professors work in the four
areas of the School: 29.4% in the Community Health, 29.4% in Hospital Pediatrics, 29.4%
in Adult Hospital and 11.8% in Mental Health. It is important to mention that 100% of
the interviewees are responsible for monitoring or supervising students in clinical
practice.</p><p>

</p><p>For the analysis of the Work Process, its elements - object, means/instruments and forms
of organization and divisions - were abstracted from the subjects&#x02019; discourses; which
were present since the Individual Interview.</p><p>Regarding the work object, the mentioned sentences show that all professors consider
that their work object is focused on the biopsychic aspect of students, who experience
the teaching-learning process, transforming knowledge. The first topic that emerged in
relation to the work object is the training of new professionals: <italic>the students
acquire tools that allow them to develop skills and strengths for their professional
development</italic> (E13), <italic>contributing to the training of the new
professionals</italic> (E3); it directly shows the teachers&#x02019; focus on the students as
their raw material, to whom the work is applied, in order to adapt the new nursing
professional to the institutional context. Likewise, the topic of Personal Realization
was identified in relation to training: <italic>it has to do with professional
development, because in order to do this, you also need to have some requirements as
a way to enhance your own professional development, I mean, your knowledge levels and
things like that</italic> (E5); in this way, at the same time that the work
transforms an object, it also transforms the man who performs it<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>, the teachers refer to a personal modification being developed in this area of
their profession, in addition to the change caused in the student. </p><p>The second element are the resources used in the teaching work, which can be separated
into two areas, with the first corresponding to the workforce, that is, the worker&#x02019;s own
abilities in terms of agility, competence or skills<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>. This study evidences the knowledge and experience as a nurse in preparing the
classes, tutoring and practical training, especially in terms of specific professional
training related to the teaching area. Knowledge and experience: <italic>on the one
hand, there is the practical experience, but there is also the theoretical training
provided, so that both can complement each other</italic> (E8). The other instruments
refer to the infrastructure available in the institution, both the classrooms and the
facilities to carry out the practical experiences with the students, as shown in the
following interview, are considered adequate. Infrastructure: <italic>there are offices
where you can do other things, so I believe that the infrastructure is adequate for
the activities to be carried out</italic> (E4). </p><p>Regarding the forms of organization, professors mention them in their speeches in
several respects. The nursing teaching work is developed through a certain form of
organization, such as a work schedule that runs from eight in the morning to five in the
afternoon on working days. Work schedule: <italic>I have a thirty-three hour workweek
from eight in the morning to five in the afternoon</italic> (E15) during the working
day, the nursing professors carry out activities related to teaching, research,
extension, with the first being performed mainly with undergraduate students. Likewise,
it is emphasized that 100% carry out practical experience monitoring, including the
School principal. Activities distribution: <italic>I carry out many practical
activities; I come to the practical class and supervise students of different levels,
from those who begin their internships to interns. A lot of work is also carried out
in the administrative scope, much is done ... issues related to the organization of
the disciplines, work teams, practical activities, elaboration of instruments,
development of instruments, texts and classes, besides having to teach in class as
well</italic> (E4). </p><p>Despite the form of organization of the teaching work, the environment is a key feature,
providing sufficient space for the physical and emotional development of the work. In
the present study, the environment is considered as good for most subjects. Work
Atmosphere: <italic>it is very good, I think that the atmosphere is good, that the
interpersonal relationships are good, that although we think differently, or that we
have differences, I mean, in relation to our ages and how we think, I think the
environment is good, it is pleasant</italic> (E4). The wages are considered
inadequate based on two aspects; first, they are not considered as representative of the
workload performed, and second, they are low when compared to the current job market.
Remuneration and market wage: <italic>here the wage is fair, although, I think it should
be paid according to the amount of activities one performs, because it is clearly
perceived that there are people who earn the same amount of money as the other ones,
and do much less</italic> (E2); <italic>I think it is lower than the market price, if
we compare with the other universities, that is, that&#x000b4;s why suddenly private
universities offer you much more, with wages considered as exorbitant, i.e., wages of
about ... you can earn the same amount working half of normal working hours, and in
fact, you can earn much more</italic>
<italic>per class</italic> (E5). </p><p>Finally, work transcends to the human being and is recognized as a transforming action
of reality, being an experience on itself<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref> and providing an additional purpose to the nursing professor. Transcendence of
work: I <italic>always enjoyed teaching, and because I liked it, I have always sought my
work, because there is a purpose, because there is transcendence in doing it</italic>
(E14). </p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Sociodemographic and labor characteristics</title><p>As regards gender, studies in Brazil also show that the nursing workforce is composed

unlike other studies conducted in Brazil, in which most professors were middle-aged
adults, 66.7%<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>. This shows that the School&#x02019;s workforce is mainly young, partly due to the
hiring of new staff in 2010, when new professors were hired, as well as the
implementation of a competency-based curriculum in 2013, which caused an increase of
teaching staff numbers.</p><p>Regarding marital status, other studies also report a larger proportion of married
professionals, with 86.3%<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup> in Brazil. This suggests that the professors of the University under
study begin young in the area of education and, therefore, have not yet married,
which is corroborated by the fact that most professors belong to a young adult age
group. Regarding children, the data of this study resemble an study carried out in
Colombia<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>, which showed that 63.2% of nursing professors had children.</p><p>The professional qualification has a key value in the new model of capitalist labor,
which requires the development of new competences by the professors. However, this
knowledge is not limited to its application, since it requires from the nurses a
reflexive exercise, involving skills and learning<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>. However, nurses recognize the need to invest in the teaching career and
maintain the motherhood as a social essence<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>, which would explain why four of the teachers interviewed still did not have
postgraduate qualification and are not enrolled in a postgraduate program. It is
important to emphasize that some nurses who return to their nursing care activities
mention the reasons why they should complete a certain academic degree<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>. Regarding the training at master&#x02019;s level, the results are consistent with a
study carried out in the United States that shows that 53.4% of professors have a
master&#x02019;s degree and 10.8% have a doctorate degree<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>, in Portugal 45.4% have a master&#x02019;s degree and 18% have a doctorate

degree and 4.8% have postgraduate qualification<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>As for the labor aspects, the length of service in the institution is not consistent
with the results of a study carried out in Colombia that shows that 47.3% have more
than five years of service in the institution<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>. Regarding the working arrangement, a study developed by the National Nursing
Council (Cofen), Brazil 2016, refers mainly to those paid per hour worked or on a
part time scheme, with 65.8% on a full-time schedule and, only 11.1%, with an
exclusive dedication type of work<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>. These results are contrary to the findings of the present study; however, it
should be taken into account that only people with a workweek of 22 hours or more
were interviewed here. This situation hinders the teaching development and the
performance of research and extension activities carried out by the nursing
professors.</p><p>Regarding the type of contract, the reality of the School under study is different
from that of Colombia, which has 46.3% of professors with a permanent contract<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref> and Portugal, with 76.5% of contracted professors<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>; since no professor in the studied School of Nursing in Chile works under
this labor contract. This is consistent with a mostly young teaching staff and who
has a postgraduate qualification, as shown in the results. Dissatisfaction with the
academic hierarchy and the absence of a fixed-term contract provokes a situation of
instability in the employment relationship, which can cause suffering on the part of
the nursing professors<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>, due to their constant concern to advance their academic career.</p><p>The university teaching development in nursing involves a multiplicity of tasks,

satisfaction, contributing to a greater permanence of nurses in the teaching

there is the personal fulfillment and the occurrence of a transcendence that goes far

requires a specific environment and, in addition to the teacher-student professional
relationship, there is still the patient. The nursing professor develops the teaching
process in its entirety, applying it not only to the students, but also to the person,
family and community.</p><p>The development of this study allowed analyzing the work process reported by the nursing
professors in a public university, achieving the proposed general objective. </p><p>This work provided the sociodemographic characterization of nursing professors, and it
could be concluded that the nursing professors of the public university under study are
mainly middle-aged adult women.</p><p>With regard to the Work Process, the nursing professors have their focus mainly on the
training of students; the structural settings are adequate to teach classes; most
professors have a full weekly workload (44 hours); the work environment is considered as
good. However, they reported low wages and high workload, so that they have to allocate
time from their personal life to the work.</p><p>In conclusion, the Work Process from a perspective of critical epidemiology allows
describing in depth the different components of the work process of nursing professors;
in addition to showing the dialectic in the development of nursing in the education
context.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><label>1</label><p>Paper extracted from Doctoral Dissertation &#x0201c;Qualidade de vida: percep&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de
