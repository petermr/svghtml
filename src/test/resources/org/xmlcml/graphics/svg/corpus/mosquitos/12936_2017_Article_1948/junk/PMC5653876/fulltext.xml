Excessive self-immersion into mental content, however, is a hallmark of psychological distress, and of several psychiatric conditions. Being aware that imagined events are not necessarily an accurate depiction of reality is a key feature of psychotherapeutic approaches akin to mindfulness-based interventions. Yet, it is still largely unknown to what extent one&#x02019;s engagement with mental content, considering it as real, biases one&#x02019;s automatic tendencies toward the world. In this study, we measured the change in subjective realism induced by a self-immersion and a mindful attention instruction, using self-reports and saliva volumes. Then, we measured behaviorally the impact of subjective realism changes on automatic approach bias toward attractive food (FAB) using an approach&#x02013;avoidance task. We found a reduction in saliva volume, followed by a reduction in FAB in the mindful condition compared to the immersed condition. During the immersed condition only, saliva volumes, state and trait measures of subjective realism, and food craving traits were positively correlated with FAB values, whereas meditation experience was negatively correlated to it. We conclude that mindful attention instructions can de-automatize food bias.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Thoughts can sometimes seem &#x0201c;subjectively real&#x0201d;, as if the imagined event was happening in the moment. This process of being self-immersed in the contents of one&#x02019;s mind has been called cognitive fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, reification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, experiential fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, or subjective realism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In contrast, being aware that thoughts or perceptions are mere representations, and not necessarily an accurate depiction of reality, is a process that has been labeled as phenomenological reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, decentering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, cognitive diffusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, mindful attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, or dereification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Subjective realism is common in daily life. For instance, merely reading about or viewing attractive food items is sufficient to trigger activation in the gustatory and reward areas in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> or to increase salivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Blood levels of ghrelin, a hormone responsible for physiological hunger, are also modulated by one&#x02019;s mere belief in the caloric values of food items<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. By contrast, becoming aware that one has self-immersed into attractive food stimuli, and that this experience is a mere transient mental event, reduces reward simulations and appetitive behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In this study, we aim to extend this research by investigating how much one&#x02019;s engagement with thoughts and perceptions, considering them as being real or not, biases one&#x02019;s automatic approaching/avoidance tendencies toward them.</p><p id="Par3">To address this question, we used a food engagement paradigm developed by Papies, Barsalou and Custers (2012)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and adapted it to make it suitable for physiological measures (such as EEG, EKG, and salivation). In the aforementioned study, the authors applied an approach-avoidance task (AAT), in a between-subject design, to show that a mindful attention instruction decreases automatic impulses towards attractive food when compared to a control or immersion instruction. These two instructions manipulated the degree of engagement with mental events as being real or not. Neutral and attractive food images were displayed on a computer screen accompanied by a cue that indicated either to approach or avoid the presented food picture. The AAT paradigm implicitly assesses automatic approach-avoidance behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The reaction times (RT) difference between incompatible conditions (i.e. avoiding attractive food) and compatible conditions (i.e. approaching attractive food) is referred to as the stimulus response compatibility (SRC) effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The SRC, which measures the specific AAT effect of food attractiveness, is labeled as the &#x0201c;Food Attractivity Bias&#x0201d; (FAB) (see Methods section for more details). Here we used a within-subject version of the task (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), where we presented the same set of neutral and attractive food images alongside both a mindful attention and an immersion instruction, presented in a randomized order across participants. With this design, we were able to measure how instruction-related changes in subjective realism influenced FAB, independently of the intrinsic saliency or reward of individual food cues.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Experimental design and validation of the behavioral marker of automatic food bias: (<bold>a</bold>) Block structure: Participants observed food pictures following either a Mindful attention or an Immersion instruction (EXPOSURE 1) before performing an approach-avoidance task (AAT). We collected saliva samples before starting the experiment (T0), after the exposure phase (T1), and after the AAT (T2). After a 45-minute break, participants repeated this paradigm while following the remaining instruction. Finally, we classified the food images as neutral or attractive based on the participants&#x02019; ratings collected after the experiment. (<bold>b</bold>) Trial structure during AAT: To induce approach or avoidance tendencies toward food images, we overlaid one of two possible cues (a blue circle or square) on the food images, requesting the participants to move a joystick as quickly as possible, either toward them or away from them. Moving the joystick toward or away from them prompted the images to grow or shrink respectively. (<bold>c</bold>) Behavioral AAT Validation: Replicating Papies <italic>et al</italic>. (2012), we found a longer reaction time (in ms) in response to attractive food images compared to neutral food when an avoidance response was required compared to approach responses. We observed this during the Immersed condition, but not the Mindful condition. (<bold>d</bold>) FAB RTs were greater during Immersed condition than the Mindful condition.

</p><p id="Par4">In addition, to obtain a physiological indicator of immersion and dereification towards food, we measured salivary volume and salivary alpha-amylase (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). It is well known that exposure to food cues generates cephalic phase responses (CPRs), an autonomic anticipation reflex that prepares the organism to receive food. Among other indicators, this reflex is characterized by an increase in salivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, the relationship between amounts of salivation, and how strongly subjective food cues are perceived as real, has not been assessed before. Following this rational, we evaluated alpha amylase activity, which is one of the first enzymes acting on the digestive process, and is highly secreted in the presence of food<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Although this enzyme is mostly studied as a marker for sympathetic system activity, in this study we measured it to assess psychophysiological engagement toward food cues.</p><p id="Par5">Through this study, we aim to refine our understanding of the cognitive processes underlying these two instructions, and their impact on food-related approach tendencies. Building on psychotherapeutic models of cognitive fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and decentering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and on phenomenological models of mindful attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, we developed qualitative and phenomenological self-report measures along four sub-processes: craving, stickiness, meta-awareness, and dereification. It is necessary to deepen our understanding about these various constructs due to the lack of agreement regarding the overlaps and differences between them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. We validated these dimensions during the piloting of our paradigm (see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and Methods and supplementary material for details). In the present framework, the immersion instruction should induce a state of high craving, high stickiness, low meta-awareness, and low dereification. The state of mindful attention should induce a state of low craving, low stickiness, high meta-awareness, and high dereification. Here we also assume that the particular contributions of these four sub-processes are modulated by the way these instructions are implemented, as well as by individual trait differences between these dimensions. To assess these processes as traits, we added the scale of cognitive fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, defined as a scale of low meta-awareness and high self-immersion, a scale of trait dereification, a scale of food craving, and the body-mass index of participants. We also recruited novices and experienced meditators among the participants, as the practice of mindfulness meditation is thought to develop the capacity of mindful attention.</p><p id="Par6">We hypothesized that decreasing subjective realism towards attractive food pictures during a brief mindful attention instruction, compared to an immersion instruction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), would reduce the automatic tendencies toward attractive food compared to neutral food, as measured by reduced FAB. Secondly, we hypothesized that the instruction-related effects on FAB would be mediated by reduced salivation and alpha-amylase activities in response to food image exposure in mindful attention compared to immersion instructions. Finally, we hypothesized that the instruction-related effects on the FAB and saliva volume would be associated with the individual differences regarding the sub-processes of craving, stickiness, meta-awareness, and dereification, as measured by state and trait self-reports and by meditation experience.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p id="Par7">25 non-meditators (without prior experience in meditation practice) and 25 meditators (from 6 months to 6 years of experience in meditation, with a total of 1415&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1227&#x02009;hours of practice), were recruited via flyers posted in universities, the location of various groups (football, volleyball, political, literature, dance, meditation, taekwondo and capoeira), and in two Buddhist meditation centers (the Shambhala center in the Vajrayana Tibetan tradition, and the Goenka center in the Theravada-Vipasssana tradition) in Santiago, Chile.

</p><p id="Par25">In the Immersed condition ANOVA, we found a food positive bias, consistent with the observed interaction of Food type and Response type (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This interaction was driven by faster approach responses than avoidance responses toward attractive food images (t-test, <italic>t</italic>(49)&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.6 <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), but not for neutral food images (t-test, <italic>t</italic>(49)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.0). In contrast, there was no bias in the Mindful attention instruction, in agreement with the lack of Food type x Response type interaction during this condition. Finally, to explore the robustness of the 3-way interaction on RT, we ran both split-half reliability analysis with a random split, and permutation analysis procedure. These analyses confirmed our main finding.</p><p id="Par26">We replicated this analysis on the Food Attractiveness Bias (FAB), and confirmed that the FAB values were greater in immersed than mindful conditions (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;15, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;32.3, M&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;5, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;28.4, respectively, t-test, <italic>t</italic>(48)&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.1 <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). This finding was not affected by the instruction order effect (see Supplementary Material, Supp. Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). We ran a split-half reliability test with our AAT scores (FAB) and obtained a Spearman-Brown coefficient of 0.505 when assessing the full sample. We detected two outliers in our split-half correlation, and removed them from the sample of the split-half reliability test, obtaining a Spearman-Brown coefficient of 0.78. Next, we re-ran our main ANOVA without these two participants, which corroborated that our main finding (i.e. the 3-way interaction on RT of Condition X Food X Response) was still present, (F (1,46)&#x02009;=&#x02009;9, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup>

This indicates that the effect was still significant when removing these two outlier participants from the split-half reliability test, which is consistent with Papies <italic>et al</italic>&#x02019;s (2012) findings.</p><p id="Par27">To summarize, the mindful attention instruction condition, but not the immersion instruction condition, down-regulated the automatic approach-oriented impulses toward attractive food images (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c and d</xref>), and this effect was reflected in the FAB index. Finally, contrary to our second hypothesis, we did not detect a four-way Group x Instruction condition x Food type x Response type interaction, suggesting that the effect of the Instruction condition on the Response type x Food type interaction was independent of meditation experience (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Salivary Volumes</title><p id="Par28">We evaluated whether, in line with the literature, the presentation of food cues during exposure triggered cephalic phase responses (CPRs) (i.e. increase in salivation).

We corrected these analyses for multiple corrections (Bonferroni corrections, alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.016). We hypothesized that the more the participants were self-immersed in the food images, the more they would have a proclivity for food craving in daily life, and the higher they would score on cognitive fusion as a trait. Conversely the more the participants were successfully applying the mindful attention instruction, the higher they would score on dereification and, for meditators, have more meditation experience.</p><p id="Par37">As predicted, scores in food craving as a trait positively correlated with FAB during the immersed condition (Pearson r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0. 36, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01), but not during the mindful condition (Pearson r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0. 12, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.38) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), indicating that participants who have a greater tendency toward food craving as a trait, also exhibited greater differences between RTs for avoidance and approach responses toward attractive food. These two measures were not correlated under the mindful condition, suggesting that the trait signature of food craving was offset by the mental state induced by the mindful attention instruction. To refine the analysis of the relationship between these two measures, we used food craving as a trait score and Instruction type to predict FAB in a multiple linear regression model. We found that the overall fit of the model was significant (Adjusted R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.17, F (3,94)&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.8, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

These results where not confirmed by a FAB Instruction interaction in the regression multiple analysis. This was most likely due to a lack of statistical power for the sample size used.

Some of these measures correlated with total number of practice hours. As the Group factor did not interact with the behavioral and physiological measures, we present these findings in the supplementary materials (Supp. Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>, and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec31"><title>Behavior</title><p id="Par40">We found the same behavioral effects as the main results obtained by Papies <italic>et al</italic>.

Specifically, we showed a reduction of automatic approach bias toward attractive food (FAB) following a mindful attention instruction when compared to an immersion instruction. Similarly, in the field of psychotherapeutic and mindfulness-based interventions (MBI), decentering-related constructs akin to mindful attention have been identified as one of the core mechanisms to overcome maladaptive behavioral, cognitive or affective habits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Examples of de-automatization mediated by mindfulness meditation have already been reported in attention, perception and physiological reflex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Autonomic physiology</title><p id="Par41">We collected participants&#x02019; salivation profiles under each instruction to characterize an objective physiological measure of subjective realism toward food cues. Although increase in salivation in response to food cue exposure or food imagery is a well-known phenomenon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, its regulation by a mindful attention instruction has not been shown before. Here we observed a reduction in saliva volume during the mindful attention instruction when compared to the immersion instruction. We also found that, during the immersed condition only, salivation correlated positively with the FAB value: participants who salivated more during exposure to food images exhibited higher FAB values in the AAT, which indicates stronger impulses toward attractive food. In cognitive terms, self-immersing in the food cue could be considered to simulate eating or tasting the food displayed by the cue. This mechanism would enhance the intake preparation reflex, strengthening the encoding of the food cue in memory and, therefore, leading to greater impulsive approach reactions toward the attractive food during the AAT. In trials where the required action was opposed to the automatic tendency (i.e. avoid attractive food), the first automatic impulse would be more difficult to overcome in the context of an enhanced intake preparation reflex, thus resulting in greater FAB values.</p><p id="Par42">By contrast, during the mindful attention condition, there was a reduction in both saliva volume and the FAB. In this condition, it was not possible to establish a relationship between salivation and FAB values in the AAT performance. These findings could be accounted for by either weaker eating simulation and autonomic preparatory food intake reflex, related to a different encoding of food images<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, or by a stronger regulation of executive conflict during the AAT performance, a capacity known to be affected by mindful attitude and training<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Accordingly, the smaller increase in saliva volume found during the exposure phase is consistent with an encoding regulation hypothesis, even though the absence of the FAB effect during the mindful condition could also be partially accounted for by an enhanced response inhibition mechanism. An examination of the brain mechanisms underlying behavior in this paradigm is needed to settle this issue.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Self reports</title><p id="Par43">The results of the post-state questionnaire indicated that participants were able to identify and differentiate their feelings, reporting less craving and greater meta-awareness and dereification in the mindful condition when compared to the immersed condition. Stickiness scores were higher for the immersed condition compared to mindful attention, albeit at trend level. Only the stickiness sub-scale predicted the FAB effect. From these results, the stickiness construct appears to be the most promising dimension to predict AAT behaviors. Contrary to our prediction, the two sub-processes of mindful attention, namely, meta-awareness and dereification, did not predict FAB. Further work is needed to identify the specific contribution of each of these sub-scales, in particular using more refined first-person interviews<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Trait</title><p id="Par44">The food craving-as-a-trait questionnaire was able to predict the FAB effect. This correlation disappeared during the mindful condition, suggesting that this &#x0201c;food craving as a trait signature&#x0201d; is offset by the mental setting provided by the mindful attention instruction, as expressed by the AAT RTs. We observed a comparable finding for cognitive fusion as a trait, but not for dereification as a trait.</p><p id="Par45">Scores from the food craving-as-a-trait questionnaire were positively correlated with BMI, which was expected, and consistent with the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Participants with greater trait cognitive fusion scores also had greater trait food craving scores, indicating that these two constructs are related as trait features. Interestingly, trait food craving was negatively correlated with the dereification-as-a-trait questionnaire scores, highlighting the relationship between automatic tendencies toward food and trait subjective realism also revealed by the AAT performance. To our knowledge, this relationship has not been reported in the literature before. From these correlations, high cognitive fusion/low derefication as a trait appears as a broader feature that might be consistent with stronger food cravings, hence facilitating greater BMIs as a result. This finding is not surprising since excessive experiential fusion is a hallmark of psychological distress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, and addictive disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, which are the most common co-morbidity features in overweight and obesity conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Meditation expertise</title><p id="Par46">Consistent with previous studies, meditators exhibited higher scores in the five-facet mindfulness questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.

Importantly, the total number of practice hours was positively correlated with the scores of the five-facet mindfulness questionnaire, negatively correlated with cognitive fusion and food craving-as-a-trait questionnaire, and negatively correlated with the AAT FAB effects. The relationship between meditation practice and trait measures that are relevant for food disorders should be further tested using a more appropriate longitudinal randomized controlled trial design.</p><p id="Par47">We initially hypothesized that meditation experience would facilitate mindful attention during the instruction.

Specifically for behaviors, the lack of 4-way interaction indicated that the capacity to sustain mindful attention toward food cues, as requested by a brief instruction, does not require formal training to induce detectable behavioral effects, and that meditation experience does not influence the capacity of self-immersing. Therefore, to differentiate the meditators from controls, a non-instructed condition would have been more appropriate to reveal any possible predisposition to engage spontaneously in mindful attention, which would result from long-term mindfulness practice. As discussed below, this additional condition was not included in our paradigm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par48">We did not include an uninstructed control task, so it is difficult to separate the effect of immersion and mindful attention specifically.
