This study was designed to elucidate if these effects are due to increased food intake, stimulated by an augmented abundance and binding ability of the hypothalamic cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R). With this aim, male mice pups were treated with a daily oral dose of AEA during lactation. Adult mice were also treated with a single oral dose of AEA, to evaluate acute food intake during 4&#x02009;h. At 21 and 160 days, CB1R protein abundance was calculated by western blot analysis. Capacity of hypothalamic membranes to specifically bind the radioligand <sup>3</sup>[H]-CP55.940 was also measured. Western blots showed a 72% increase in CB1R abundance in AEA-treated 21-day-old mice, without differences in adult mice. Additionally, specific binding of <sup>3</sup>[H]-CP55.940 to hypothalamic membranes from adult mice was significantly lower in those mice treated with AEA during lactation. Moreover, AEA did not stimulate acute food intake in both, AEA-treated and control mice. Results suggest that metabolic alterations found in adult mice because of AEA treatment during lactation are not associated with hypothalamic CB1R.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient&#x000ed;fico y Tecnol&#x000f3;gico</funding-source><award-id>1130106</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The mechanism that regulates food intake is controlled by the hypothalamus, which is continuously informed about the nutritional and energy status of the body through peripheral and central orexigenic or anorexigenic signals. These signals include peripheral satiety messages and nerve inputs provided by adiposity, leptin, and intestinal peptides, while central messages are communicated by neuropeptides, monoamines, and endocannabinoids [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The endocannabinoid system is involved in food intake regulation through the expression and/or action of several hypothalamic anorexigenic and orexigenic mediators. Endocannabinoids activate cannabinoid type 1 and type 2 receptors (CB1R/CB2R). Type 1 receptors are colocalized with corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), with melanin-concentrating hormone in the lateral hypothalamus, and with the preproorexin in the ventromedial hypothalamus [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The CB1R gene deletion upregulates CRH, pointing to a tonic inhibition of the expression of this anorectic mediator by endocannabinoids [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, in the PVN, postsynaptic endocannabinoids, through CB1R, induce a retrograde inhibition of the glutamatergic release from neurons, thus mediating the rapid inhibition of corticosterone-induced CRH release [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Retrograde signalling exerted by endocannabinoids produced in postsynaptic depolarized neurons also inhibits the presynaptic release of GABA in the lateral hypothalamus and arcuate nucleus [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], confirming the role of the endocannabinoid system in the central circuits that regulate appetite.</p><p>Additionally, it has been suggested that endocannabinoids affect the motivational process towards food consumption by stimulating neuronal networks in the nucleus accumbens [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. All these antecedents indicate that the endocannabinoid system is one of the key components in the central regulation of energy homeostasis.</p><p>Several studies in animal models have shown that administration of endocannabinoids stimulates food ingestion [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Specifically, the administration of anandamide both centrally and peripherally in rodents stimulates food consumption [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, this endocannabinoid is also able to stimulate food intake in satiated fish in a dose-dependent manner, with this effect being observed at concentrations as low as 1&#x02009;pg/g of body weight [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Stimulation of CB1R with synthetic, high affinity agonists stimulates food intake even in satiated animals [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Pharmacological blockade of the receptor by systemic administration of SR141716A (Rimonabant), the first selective antagonist-inverse agonist of CB1R, reduces the stimulatory effect of the agonist and decreases both palatable food consumption in animals fed ad libitum and the normal food consumption in fasting animals [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Other evidences obtained in mice with a deletion of the gene encoding the CB1R (CB1R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) show that these mice are hypophagic and have less visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue and greater lean mass when compared to native mice [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Additionally, when CB1R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are subjected to a high fat diet, they are resistant to obesity, while native mice get obese to the same diet [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In previous studies, we have shown that administration of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) during lactation induces overweight, fat accumulation, and metabolic alterations such as insulin resistance in adult CD1 mice, in concomitance to a higher expression of CB1R in visceral adipose tissue. However, it is not clear whether weight gain is due to a priming, long-term effect of AEA on its receptor in central nervous system, or in peripheral tissues such as the adipose tissue or both [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>With all these antecedents in mind, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of oral administration of AEA to male mice pups during lactation on the abundance and binding capacity of the hypothalamic CB1R, to relate it with acute AEA-stimulated and long-term unstimulated food intake.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows CB1R protein expression in hypothalamus of 21- and 150-day-old control and AEA-treated mice.

Binding of CP-55.940 to Hypothalamic Membrane Preparation</title><p>When assessing endocannabinoid receptors in hypothalamic membrane preparations, to evaluate their binding capacity to its radioactive ligand <sup>3</sup>[H]-CP55.940, it is observed that 150-day-old AEA-treated mice have a significantly lower total specific binding than control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This difference is not observed in hypothalamic membrane preparations from 21-day-old mice (data not shown). It should pointed out that although the radioligand <sup>3</sup>[H]-CP55.940 is able to bind with similar affinity to both CB1 and CB2 receptors, AEA shows a slightly more affinity for CB1R. However, 4 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M AEA concentration used to displace <sup>3</sup>[H]-CP55.940 might displace binding from both receptors, due to close Ki of AEA for CB1 (88&#x02009;nM) and CB2 (268&#x02009;nM). Consequently, displacement with AEA should indicate specific binding to both receptors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>The present results indicate that mice treated during lactation with a daily oral dose of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) show a significant increase in the hypothalamic CB1R protein abundance at 21 days of age, when compared to controls. Nevertheless, this difference in CB1R protein abundance is not maintained until adulthood because 150-day-old animals from both groups show similar hypothalamic CB1R levels. The greater body weight previously observed in AEA-treated mice [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] may be associated with a higher food intake, given the importance of the central endocannabinoid system in the mechanisms modulating food intake, where hypothalamic CB1R plays a key role [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the higher accumulated food intake over 150 days, found in AEA-treated animals, might not be associated with the levels of CB1R, which are similar to the CB1R level found in control mice. Additionally, 130-day-old AEA-treated animals and controls consumed the same amount of food in response to an acute, single oral dose of AEA, a fact that is concordant with the finding of the same CB1R levels in both groups. Interestingly, presence of cannabinoids receptors in hypothalamic membranes evidenced by its binding ability to CP-55940, a synthetic CB1R/CB2R agonist, is decreased in 150-day-old AEA-treated mice. Since total CB1R protein abundance is similar in both groups according to western blot results obtained, a differential, long-term programming of receptor compartmentalization due to AEA treatment during lactation may be suggested.</p><p>The higher cumulative food intake observed in AEA-treated mice, might be explained by another mechanism not directly involving abundance of CB1R in hypothalamic membranes. Thus, the explanation should be focused on the fact that those receptors should be activated by appropriate levels of endocannabinoids. In this regard, it is known that leptin exerts an inhibitory effect on hypothalamic endocannabinoid [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] production, leading to a decreased retrograde activation of CB1R, which finally results in a lower food intake. In this sense, it is known that obese mice with defective leptin signalling (<italic>ob/ob</italic> and<italic> db/db</italic>) show elevated levels of hypothalamic endocannabinoids [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which are able to overactivate CB1R, regardless of its population. Furthermore, leptin administration decreases both food intake and endocannabinoid levels in wild type and<italic> ob/ob</italic> mice [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Since we have previously shown that AEA-treated animals have increased body weight mainly due to increased body fat content in addition to higher circulating levels of leptin [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], it may be suggested that these mice could develop some level of chronic leptin resistance involved in the mild increased cumulative food intake observed. In this condition, hypothalamic endocannabinoid levels should be enough to chronically activate the decreased population of cannabinoids receptors found in hypothalamic membranes of AEA-treated mice, leading to the higher cumulative food intake observed in this study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by the Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog&#x000ed;a de Chile (Fondecyt), Grant no. 1130106.</p></ack><sec><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Valassi</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Scacchi</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cavagnini</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Neuroendocrine control of food intake</article-title><source><italic>Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases</italic></source><year>2008</year><volume>18</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>158</fpage><lpage>168</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.numecd.2007.06.004</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="other">2-s2.0-39549099705</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cota</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Marsicano</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsch&#x000f6;p</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>The endogenous cennabinoid system affects energy balance via central orexigenic drive and peripheral lipogenesis</article-title><source><italic>Journal of Clinical Investigation</italic></source><year>2003</year><volume>112</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>423</fpage><lpage>431</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="other">2-s2.0-0041886785</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1172/JCI200317725</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12897210</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Horvath</surname><given-names>T.
