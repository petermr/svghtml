One application of this technology is drug delivery systems based on nanoparticles obtained from natural or synthetic sources. An example of these systems is synthetized from poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate), which is a biodegradable, biocompatible and a low production cost polymer. The aim of this work was to investigate the uptake mechanism of PHBV nanoparticles in two different epithelial cell lines (HeLa and SKOV-3).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>As a first step, we characterized size, shape and surface charge of nanoparticles using dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Intracellular incorporation was evaluated through flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy using intracellular markers. We concluded that cellular uptake mechanism is carried out in a time, concentration and energy dependent way. Our results showed that nanoparticle uptake displays a cell-specific pattern, since we have observed different colocalization in two different cell lines. In HeLa (Cervical cancer cells) this process may occur via classical endocytosis pathway and some internalization via caveolin-dependent was also observed, whereas in SKOV-3 (Ovarian cancer cells) these patterns were not observed. Rearrangement of actin filaments showed differential nanoparticle internalization patterns for HeLa and SKOV-3. Additionally, final fate of nanoparticles was also determined, showing that in both cell lines, nanoparticles ended up in lysosomes but at different times, where they are finally degraded, thereby releasing their contents.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results, provide novel insight about PHBV nanoparticles internalization suggesting that for develop a proper drug delivery system is critical understand the uptake mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12951-016-0241-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>UNAB Regular Grant</institution></funding-source><award-id>DI-316-13/R</award-id><award-id>DI-695</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vilos</surname><given-names>Cristian</given-names></name><name><surname>Otero</surname><given-names>Carolina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Conicyt</institution></funding-source><award-id>PhD Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>M&#x000e1;rquez-Miranda</surname><given-names>Valeria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>CONICYT + PAI</institution></funding-source><award-id>Concurso Nacional Tesis de Doctorado en la Empresa</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>M&#x000e1;rquez-Miranda</surname><given-names>Valeria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Fraunhofer Chile Research</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Innova-Chile CORFO</institution></funding-source><award-id>FCR-CSB 09CEII-6991</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Nilo</surname><given-names>Fernando D.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Anillo Cient&#x000ed;fico</institution></funding-source><award-id>ACT1107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Nilo</surname><given-names>Fernando D.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>BASAL Grant</institution></funding-source><award-id>FB0807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Otero</surname><given-names>Carolina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>FONDECYT</institution></funding-source><award-id>1161438</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vilos</surname><given-names>Cristian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>MECESUP PMI-UAB</institution></funding-source><award-id>1301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vilos</surname><given-names>Cristian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Nanotechnology is the science of engineering materials and systems on a molecular scale. Its application to medicine, &#x0201c;nanomedicine&#x0201d;, has enabled the development of nano-sized drug-delivery vehicles. These nanocarriers are generally&#x000a0;&#x0003c;200&#x000a0;nm in size and have the ability to carry and deliver therapeutics to discrete sites into the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Due to their small size, increased stability and sustained drug release properties, biodegradable polymeric nanocarriers display several advantages, being more effective for cancer treatment than other nanoparticles (e.g. metallic ones) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Nanoparticles are being developed for in vivo tumor imaging, targeted drug delivery and biomolecular profiling of cancer biomarkers. Biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) have been shown promissory as controlled drug delivery systems, showing high therapeutic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Currently, delivery technologies using cell-targeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] or specific targeting of organelles inside a cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] are becoming increasingly important as an area of scientific investigation. In cancer, polymeric NPs can be used to deliver chemotherapeutics towards tumor cells, with high efficiency and reduced cytotoxicity on healthy tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The activity of the drug carried by the NPs depends on how and where the NPs are disassembled. The mechanism of NPs endocytosis and trafficking is still a subject of controversy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Among polymeric NPs, (3-hydroxybutyric acid-co-3 hydroxyvaleric acid) (PHBV) constitutes a promissory alternative, more accessible and cheaper than similar polymers such as poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA); the last one has been widely used in drug delivery in different cancer types and have an FDA approval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. PHBV is a biodegradable and biocompatible polyester, composed of two monomers: hydroxybutyrate and hydroxyvalerate and, since it is produced by bacteria or eukaryotic cells, it can be synthesized in large scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, at present, little is known about its uptake and distribution into mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In the case of hydroxybutyrate-composed homopolymers (PHB), it has been described that is primarily found complexed with other molecules, and can be found in several subcellular organelles of eukaryotic organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] or associated with proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A previous study has suggested that PHB is associated in granules that accumulate in the cytoplasm, similar to the behavior in bacteria, which might constitute an &#x02018;energy reservoir&#x02019;. In the same study, the colocalization of PHV granules with organelles was inspected in U87 cells, showing no remarkable colocalization with lysosomes, mitochondria, or endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>PHBV copolymer reduces the chain packing and decreases crystalline melting point, due to the ethyl chain of the valerate, which increases flexibility, impact strength, and ductility in comparison to hydroxybutyrate homopolymer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, previous studies have revealed the usefulness of PHBV nanoparticles in the encapsulation of paclitaxel drugs, protecting this anticancer agent against premature degradation, by allowing 48&#x000a0;h of toxicity protection. Other applications of PHBV in medicine include a formulation loaded with antibiotics for veterinary uses, which allows protecting the drug for inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Previous work demonstrates that most NPs, including those formed from biodegradable polymers such as PLGA, are taken up by an endocytic process, and their uptake is concentration- and time-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. PLGA NPs for delivery of therapeutics are of particular interest due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability and ability to maintain therapeutic drug levels for sustained periods of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, further investigation is required to determine the mechanisms and therapeutic potential of intracellular targeting of nano-delivery systems in vivo for the goal of an anticancer vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Other studies on PLGA uses for targeting have shown that the intracellular fate of nanoparticles may be altered by their surface decoration with a targeting molecule. In the case of PLGA, previous studies in smooth muscle cells have revealed that these NPs can undergo exocytosis in about 65%; meaning that the NPs are effectively internalized, but they escape from the cells before releasing their content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The fraction of NPs that escapes from the endosomes to the cytosolic compartments was shown to be retained inside cells, delivering the encapsulated agent slowly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The polymer matrix prevents the degradation of the drug and the duration and levels of drug released from the NPs can be easily modulated by altering the formulation. Meanwhile, in hepatoma cells, it has been described that PLGA NPs are taken up by the classical clathrin pathway and that they effectively escape from lysosomes and contribute to enhancing the efficiency of intracellular delivery and tumor therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>In summary, discovering the intracellular fate of NPs and the investigation of their endocytic mechanism is particularly significant with the aim of using them as drug carriers, since in some cases, they may be taken back to the extracellular media (via recycling endosomes), or they may be degraded in lysosomes or be trapped in an organelle, without releasing its content at the desired site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, escaping from the endosomes to reach other organelles is another important issue to be addressed.</p><p>The present manuscript aims to provide insights about the possible routes of internalization and escaping from the endosomal sorting pathway of PHBV nanoparticles, in two different cell lines: in HeLa (cervix cancer) and SKOV-3 (ovarian cancer). HeLa cells was chosen because its endocytic machinery is very well characterized, and SKOV-3 cells because these cells are challenging due to their common chemoresistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] in order to investigate how a possible drug treatment (encapsulated in a nanoparticle) may stay inside the cell, where normally drugs are pumped out.</p><p>Several compartments, such as early endosomes (Transferrin Conjugate or EEA1 antibody), late endosomes (Lysotracker or Rab7 antibody) and lysosomes (Lysotracker or LAMP1 antibody), were chosen for this investigation, as they are involved in transport, destination, release, and degradation of soluble and membrane-bound macromolecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Endosome and lysosome formation require microtubules to form a network in the cytoplasm, whereas actin generates forces to induce membrane invaginations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], thereby microtubules and actin cytoskeleton were also analyzed.</p><p>These methods may contribute to the development of PHBV NPs as drug carriers, enabling to enhance the delivery of chemotherapeutics inside the cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p>Poly (3-hydroxybutyric acid-co-hydroxyvaleric acid) (PHBV) with 12 wt% PHV and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (average mol wt. 30,000&#x02013;70,000) and glutathione were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

Briefly, 400&#x000a0;&#x000b5;L of distilled water were added to 1&#x000a0;mL of a solution of 3&#x000a0;mg/mL of PHBV (Sigma-Aldrich, Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) in dichloromethane (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The first emulsion (w1/o1) was prepared by sonication in an ultrasonic processor equipped with a microtip probe for 40&#x000a0;s at 100% in an ice bath. The water-in-oil emulsion was further emulsified by sonication under the same conditions in 4&#x000a0;mL of an aqueous solution of 5&#x000a0;mg/mL PVA (w2). This w1/o1/w2 emulsion was immediately poured into a beaker containing 20&#x000a0;mL of a 0.5&#x000a0;mg/mL PVA solution. The mixture was stirred with an overhead propeller for 12&#x000a0;h under a flow hood, and the solvent was allowed to evaporate. The remaining organic solvent and free molecules were removed by passing the particle solution 3 times through an Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter. Finally, NPs were concentrated by centrifugation and resuspended in 500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for further use. A modification of the technique described was used for the synthesis of functionalized nanoparticles with a marker. The same procedure was followed, except the aqueous phase (W1) was replaced by 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of a solution of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) 1&#x000a0;mg/mL; 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of a solution of Nile Red (RN) 1&#x000a0;mg/mL; or 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of the LysoTracker&#x000ae; Red DND-99 fluorescent probe.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>PHBV nanoparticles characterization by dynamic light scattering (DLS)</title><p>Each preparation was suspended in 1&#x000a0;mL of PBS pH 7.4 and nanoparticles diameter (nm), polydispersity coefficient (PdI) and zeta potential (mV) were determined by light scattering technique using a Zetasizer Nano-ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)</title><p>NPs structure was also characterized using transmission electron microscopy. One drop of the NP sample was placed onto an ultra-thin Lacey carbon-coated 400-mesh copper grid and allowed to dry at room temperature for 10&#x000a0;min prior to image acquisition, ensuring no more than 1&#x000a0;min of electron beam exposure to the sample. TEM images were acquired using an LVEM5 electron microscope (Delong Instrument, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) at a nominal operating voltage of 5&#x000a0;kV. The small volume of the vacuum chamber in the LVEM5 microscope facilitates rapid sample visualization within 3&#x000a0;min before observation. The low voltage used delivers high contrast in soft materials (up to 20-fold) compared with high-voltage electron microscopes, which use accelerating voltages of approximately 100&#x000a0;kV; this procedure facilitates the emission of staining procedures and allows the direct visualization of biological samples.

</p><p>Studies have revealed a direct relationship between the size of the NPs and the endocytic pathway. Particles with a size less than 200&#x000a0;nm were internalized into non-phagocytic, murine melanome cells B16-F10 via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The size of clathrin-coated pits varies between different cell types within the same species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The size of clathrin-coated vesicles depends on the size of its cargo, having an upper limit of 200&#x000a0;nm external diameter in the case of virus uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>In a similar way, 50 and 120&#x000a0;nm folate-decorated poly(ethylene glycol)-polycaprolactone nanoparticles were found to be internalized via both clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis in ARPE-19 cells. However, 250&#x000a0;nm nanoparticles, were only internalized via caveolae-mediated pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], despite some articles have described an upper limit size of&#x000a0;~150&#x000a0;nm for passage through caveolae vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>In a more recent article, glycopeptide engineered PLGA nanoparticles, closely related to the PHBV nanoparticles studied here, were investigated to determine their endocytic mechanism. As demonstrated by confocal microscopy analysis, these nanoparticles, 170&#x000a0;nm in diameter, strongly colocalized with clathrin related-but not with caveolin related-routes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows a representative micrograph of control preparation, which was obtained through transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

In previous reports, spherical-shaped gold NPs displayed higher and faster rate of endocytosis than disk or rod-shaped nanoparticles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In contrast, other researchers have suggested a preferential internalization of polyethylene glycol nanoparticles having a rod or cylindrical shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. All these records indicate that spherical morphology of PHBV nanoparticles may not be decisive in entering the cells, but the setting of other features&#x02014;such as the chemical nature, size, and charge&#x02014;are also implied in how they are taken up.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>PHBV nanoparticle micrograph.

</p><p>Surface charge of nanoparticles is another important parameter to characterize because the surface of the nanoparticle interacts directly with the biological environment. Due to the chemical nature conferred by the phospholipids, the plasma membrane has a negative charge. For this reason, positively-charged drug delivery systems exhibit better adhesion and a higher internalization rate. An example of this phenomenon has been demonstrated by Harush-Frenkel et al., who revealed in HeLa cells, that polymeric nanoparticles of PLA-PEG coated with cationic lipid stearylamine (~ +35&#x000a0;mV) evidence greater incorporation than the same NPs but negatively charged (~ &#x02212;35&#x000a0;mV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, in the case of possible use in vivo of these nanoplatforms, the interaction with plasma proteins is reduced if the NPs are negatively charged, decreasing the probabilities of activation of immune response by monocytes and macrophages in the bloodstream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Uptake measurement of PHBV nanoparticles</title><p>To characterize how PHBV nanoparticles are taken up by the cells, we quantified their incorporation through flow cytometry. This measurement was performed under different conditions, including the use of different formulations of NPs, variation of the incubation time, type of cells, and modifying the energy conditions of the cell culture. The latter condition was evaluated because endocytosis is an active cellular process, which requires energy (ATP).</p><p>The time required for the incorporation of NPs in a cell system is critical to evaluate its use for in vivo applications. While NPs interacts with the plasma membrane, cell will package this &#x0201c;foreign agent&#x0201d; with different surface molecules, allowing their uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Generally, by increasing the time which cells are exposed to NPs, their uptake increases. However, this process will be finally determined by the balance between entry and excretion of NPs. Time dependence in NPs incorporation was evaluated in PMBC, HeLa and SKOV-3. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, HeLa (a) and SKOV-3 (b) show time-dependence, as evidenced by a high mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) given by the encapsulated fluorophore, showing a similar behavior obtained by Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Nevertheless, the same phenomenon was not observed in PBMC. After 5&#x000a0;min of incubation, a high fluorescence intensity was observed, which did not vary under longer incubation, reaching stable values. Most cellular models used so far to investigate nanoparticle cellular uptake do not take into account cellular heterogeneity in the blood stream, for instance, the presence of macrophages or neutrophils. Differences in NPs uptake and/or NPs phagocytosis can be found even between macrophages mouse strains dependent on their preference for either Th1- or Th2-responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The mentioned phenomena may explain why in our experiments performed with PBMC, we observed a faster NPs internalization compared to the other cell lines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, d).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Quantification of the cellular uptake of PHBV nanoparticles: time dependency.

</p><p>NPs concentration is another important feature to be analyzed because it can impact uptake efficiency and cytotoxicity induction.

</p><p>PBMC showed faster cellular uptake in time (comparing with the other cells at 5&#x000a0;min). This phenomenon was not observed in the other cell lines probably because PBMC contains macrophages and neutrophils which endocytosis mechanism is most via phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Nevertheless, uptake after 5&#x000a0;min seems to be inefficient probably because PBMC are smaller cells compared to the other cell lines (HeLa and SKOV-3 cells are relative equal in size). This idea is supported by Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d, which shows that PBMC uptake with different concentrations reach a plateau, absorbing less NPS than the other cell lines. On the other hand, cell lines (which are derived from a tumor) display a high metabolic rate, process that can respond to a higher cellular uptake without reaching a plateau. This effect was more evident in HeLa cells than SKOV-3 cells.</p><p>We have estimated an approximate number of NPs at a given NP mass concentration depicted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, following the previous data from Vilos et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In this way, the fluctuation in the number of NPs at 500&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL compared to 1000&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL represents only a twofold increase in picomoles/mL. It must be noted that an increase in the concentration of the solution might not be &#x0201c;saturating&#x0201d; the cells, because the NPs could enter progressively. Probably, at a high solution concentration such as 1000&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL, NPs can enter in similar extent than at 500&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL to the cells, as Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows, but probably afterwards, every NP can eventually enter the cells.</p><p>Internalization and processing of nanoparticles into the cells is an active process, which requires energy to be performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Dependence of energy (i.e. ATP) was assessed in HeLa and SKOV-3 cells. Both cell lines were incubated at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, after that the uptake of nanoparticles was quantified. As seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, when both cell lines were incubated at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C a decrease of NPs internalization was observed, suggesting endocytosis inhibition. Other groups also have reported this behavior. Qaddoumi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] reported a decrease of about 90% in the uptake of PLGA nanoparticles in rabbit conjunctival epithelial cells (RCEC), while Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] also observed a decrease in uptake of polymeric nanoparticles in human cell lines Hep-G2, HuH-7, and PLC. By the other hand, treatment with sodium azide (SA) solution, which blocks electron transport chain, showed a decrease of the entry of NPs, however, this decay is less significant than the observed at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that SA inhibits synthesis of ATP, then cells may use exogenous ATP for operation, allowing entry of PHBV nanoparticles, as been suggested by Gratton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Other researchers have evaluated inhibition of endocytosis adding sodium azide, obtaining similar results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].

</p><p>In contrast to clathrin-mediated, classic route, caveolar uptake has been suggested to avoid lysosomes. Caveolae vesicles fuse with caveosomes, delivering their content to other cellular compartments. By avoiding acidic routes, a caveolar pathway may be advantageous for drug delivery. In this manner, ligands can be developed to target caveolar domains and reaching a more efficient delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p>Macropinocytosis mechanism was also indirectly evaluated. This pathway is characterized by the rearrangement of actin filaments in the cytoplasm when a particle is incorporated. As a marker of actin monomers, Phalloidin, which is a mycotoxin that binds irreversibly to actin monomers, was conjugated to Alexa Fluor&#x000ae; 488 fluorophore. HeLa and SKOV-3 cell lines were incubated for 15 and 30&#x000a0;min with a PHBV-RN solution. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> shows that HeLa exhibits stress fibers in the presence of PHBV nanoparticles (arrowheads). These fibers are characteristic of rearrangement of actin filaments in cellular processes such as macropinocytosis. It is important to note that in SKOV-3, these types of fibers are not seen, showing the same form as control treatment.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;8</label><caption><p>Evaluation of actin filaments rearrangement in the presence of PHBV nanoparticles.

</p><p>In summary, NPs showed different cell entry ways depending on the cell type; specifically, in SKOV-3, NPs appear to enter through an independent way from the traditional routes, unlike the behavior observed in HeLa cells (summary of the colocalization analysis is given in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Extent of colocalization of PHBV nanoparticles with endocytosis markers in HeLa and SKOV-3 cells</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2"/><th align="left" colspan="2">CAV-1</th><th align="left" colspan="2">EEA-1</th><th align="left">WGA</th></tr><tr><th align="left">5&#x000a0;min</th><th align="left">15&#x000a0;min</th><th align="left">5&#x000a0;min</th><th align="left">15&#x000a0;min</th><th align="left">5&#x000a0;min</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">HeLa (%)</td><td align="left">41.46</td><td align="left">30.62</td><td char="." align="char">99.42</td><td char="." align="char">99.39</td><td char="." align="char">99.98</td></tr><tr><td align="left">SKOV-3 (%)</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">0</td><td char="." align="char">21.17</td><td char="." align="char">23.08</td><td char="." align="char">99.95</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
</p><p>To determine the participation of the proteins from the cell membrane in the uptake of NPs, a reducible biotin assay was performed. By using a reducing agent such as glutathione, this method allows discriminating surface proteins that enter into the cell under a certain condition. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, apparently there were no specific proteins involved in the incorporation of nanoparticles, because no differences were observed in the protein pattern obtained with NPs compared to the control condition without treatment. However, it is important to remark that the protein membrane pattern evaluated by western blot is completely different between both cell lines, suggesting that endocytosis machinery and plasma membrane proteins together with its dynamics may be different among them. This observation could explain our immunofluorescence results that showed that actin filaments, which are the major cytoskeletal proteins, are not acting in the NPs entry to SKOV-3 cells, differently to Hela cells.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;9</label><caption><p>Analysis of proteins involved in cellular uptake of PHBV nanoparticles. HeLa and SKOV-3 cells were subjected to reducible biotin assay to determine possible membrane proteins involved in nanoparticles uptake. 40&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g of proteins from cell lysate were resolved through SDS-PAGE, then transferred to PDVF membrane and finally, incubated with streptavidin-HRP (1:1000). <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-actin (47&#x000a0;kDa) was used as loading control</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12951_2016_241_Fig9_HTML" id="MO9"/></fig>
</p><p>Furthermore, to determine the final fate of the NPs in both cell lines, colocalization with LAMP-1 (Lysosome-Associated Membrane Protein 1) antibody was performed by immunofluorescence (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>, <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>), showing that in both cases NPs do colocalize with lysosomes but at different times: in HeLa cells, transit towards lysosomes was faster than in SKOV-3, probably due to that in Hela, the classical entry pathway is preferred by the NPs, allowing more expedite transit to the lysosomes, unlike SKOV-3. Moreover, in experiments performed with HL-60, a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, after 4&#x000a0;h of incubation with NPs containing the fluorophore FITC, its content was observed in the cytoplasm meaning that somehow NP content may be released by the lysosomes where NPs may be degraded (data not shown).<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;10</label><caption><p>Determination of final nanoparticle fate in HeLa cells.

</p><p>To evaluate NPs final fate through a different approach, we performed an experiment with NPs encapsulating LysoTracker&#x000ae; probe, which consist on a fluorophore linked to a weak base that is only partially protonated at neutral pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. This probe is highly selective for acidic organelles. If the NPs release their content in the lysosome, it may be detected by fluorescence microscopy. In this way, fluorescence is not detected when LysoTracker&#x000ae; is trafficking through the endosomes. Our results in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref> shows that after 4&#x000a0;h, fluorescence can be detected, demonstrating that NPs are degraded in the lysosome, releasing their content. In vitro degradation of PHBV has been shown very slow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. At extreme conditions, such as at acid/basic pH, degradation seems to undergo by a decrease in the molecular weight and then, by a weight loss, when the mechanical strength is lost, and the remaining PHBV breaks down into small fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;12</label><caption><p>Evaluation of nanoparticle degradation. HeLa and SKOV-3 cells were incubated with PHBV-Lysotracker&#x000ae; DND-99/nanoparticles for 4&#x000a0;h at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, then cells were fixed and observed through fluorescence microscopy.

</p><p>When cells were incubated with PHBV NPs, after trafficking through the endo-lysosome pathway, which finally ends at lysosomes, these organelles enter into a special stage where they fused and get polarized, resembling what normally happens during autophagy and immunological synapsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. To investigate whether NPs/cell incubation may trigger autophagy, we analyze LC3 expression by western blot in the two different cell lines, which showed no LC3 expression (data not shown) suggesting that lysosomal fusion not be triggering by an autophagy event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. These findings lead to propose the recruitment of a possible MTOC (Microtubule Organizing Center) towards a particular area, allowing the local regulation of potential exocytosis and endocytosis processes by concentrating at a specific place the required molecular machinery. A scheme of PHBV NPs entry pathway for HeLa and SKOV-3 cell lines suggested in this article is depicted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>.<fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;13</label><caption><p>PHBV nanoparticle intracellular trafficking pathway in HeLa and SKOV-3 cells scheme.
