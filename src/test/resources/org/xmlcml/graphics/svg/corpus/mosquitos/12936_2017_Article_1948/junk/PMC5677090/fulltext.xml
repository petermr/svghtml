The constellation of symptoms is known as Fragile-X syndrome (FXS). The syndrome in humans is caused by expansion of an unstable, CGG triplet repeat with subsequent silencing of the fragile-X mental retardation-1 (<italic>FMR1</italic>) gene that encodes FMRP. FXS is a common monogenic disorder that affects 1 in 3,600 males and 1 in 4,000&#x02013;6,000 females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. FXS is severely debilitating in males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Females generally are less affected than males due to mosaicism resulting from X-chromosome inactivation which occurs randomly early in embryogenesis.</p><p id="Par3">Present both pre- and post-synaptically, FMRP associates with and suppresses the translation of mRNA important for synaptic function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Consequently, genetic ablation of FMRP allows the over expression of proteins that normally would be tightly regulated components of the synapse such as channels, signaling and structural components. The syndrome can be modeled in mice and fruit flies by deletion of the <italic>fmr1</italic> gene in mice and the highly conserved <italic>Dfmr1</italic> gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic>

Using a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model in which the flies are heterozygous for the <italic>Dmfr1</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> null allele, Kanellopoulos and coworkers reported that treatment with rolipram, a PDE4 inhibitor, rescued the olfactory learning deficit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The learning deficit also was rescued by crossing the <italic>Dmfr1</italic>
<sup>3</sup> allele onto a genetic background lacking the fly <italic>dunce</italic> gene (<italic>Dnc</italic>), the single <italic>Drosophila</italic> PDE4 gene. These findings were extended by Choi and coworkers to a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model in which <italic>Dmfr1</italic> was completely absent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Two PDE4 inhibitors, rolipram and RO201724, were shown to reverse the behavioral deficits in <italic>Dmfr1</italic> null flies. A low dose of rolipram did not rescue the structural abnormalities in the mushroom body neurons, while a high dose rescued both behavioral and structural phenotypes. Choi and coworkers also showed genetic rescue of the <italic>Dmfr1</italic> null behavioral and structural phenotypes on the <italic>dunce</italic> background. Thus, reducing PDE4 activity in the <italic>Drosophila Dmfr1</italic> models rescues multiple aspects of the Fragile-X phenotype.</p><p id="Par5">While the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome contains a single PDE4 gene, this has been expanded to a small gene family in higher organisms. The genomes of humans and other mammals contain four PDE4 genes (PDE4A-D)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The gene family contains two upstream conserved regions (UCR1 &#x00026; UCR2) important for regulation of PDE4 enzymatic activity that distinguish the PDE4 enzymes from other PDE. UCR1 and UCR2 are ancestral domains that are conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> but not in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> or yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Each gene expresses multiple proteins that differ in N-terminal targeting sequences, their assembly into dimeric or monomeric forms of the PDE4 enzyme, and their post-translation regulation through protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The importance of PDE4D for human cognition is shown by ultra-rare, autosomal dominant mutations in PDE4D that cause acrodysostosis without hormone resistance (ACRDYS2), a neurodevelopmental syndrome causing short stature, brachydactyly (short fingers and toes), nasal hypoplasia and intellectual disability with speech and psychomotor retardation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. All of the ACRDYS2 mutations described to date are missense mutations that alter amino acids on the surface of the protein such as the contact residues between the PDE4D catalytic domain and the UCR2 regulatory domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. One mutation (serine129 to alanine) removes the PKA phosphorylation site on the UCR1 regulatory domain, and therefore prevents activation of PDE4D enzymatic activity in response to cAMP signaling. The implication is that dysregulation of the spatial and temporal patterning of cAMP signaling by reducing cAMP hydrolysis, as in <italic>Drosophila dunce</italic> mutant flies, impairs associative memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. PDE4D negative allosteric modulators (PDE4D-NAM) such as BPN14770 inhibit the enzyme by closing the UCR2 regulatory domain across the active site, thereby limiting access of cAMP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Unlike rolipram and RO201724, which inhibit all subtypes of PDE4, BPN14770 is selective for the PDE4D subtype. We therefore sought to assess the therapeutic benefit of BPN14770 in adult, male <italic>fmr1</italic> gene deleted mice in order to extend previous studies in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> FXS model.</p><p id="Par6">FXS patients display a range of neuropsychiatric symptoms including intellectual disability, delayed language acquisition, poor social interaction, hyperarousal, hypersensitivity, repetitive behaviors, disrupted sleep, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. These behavioral changes are modeled in adult male <italic>fmr1</italic> KO mice which display a spectrum of behavioral phenotypes due to the <italic>fmr1</italic> gene deletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The mutant mice show hyperarousal in the open field test, have impaired social interaction, are less likely to build nests when provided cotton batting and are less likely to bury marbles in the cage bedding. Adult male mice were used for all studies as male FXS patients typically suffer more severe symptoms than do female patients due to the single X chromosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

The pro-cognitive effects of PDE4 inhibitors are potentially beneficial to humans with mosaic fragile X, a common presentation in males with the fragile X mutation and a universal condition in females with fragile X.

In the original study by Berry-Kravis and Huttenlocher<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, platelets from FXS patients were found to have lower basal and stimulated cAMP levels than controls. Basal, prostaglandin E1 and forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels were 50&#x02013;60% of controls. In their experiment, a non-selective PDE inhibitor (1-isobutyl-3-methylxanthine) was used to inhibit all platelet PDE activity. This indicates that cAMP dysregulation is likely at the level of adenylate cyclase rather than due to dysregulation of a PDE. The dominant PDE in platelets is PDE3, the target of cilostazol, a selective PDE3 inhibitor indicated for the treatment of intermittent claudication in individuals with peripheral vascular disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. PDE4 isoenzymes are absent from platelets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Thus, it is unlikely that dysregulation of PDE4D could account for the alteration in cAMP levels seen in multiple tissues in FXS, nor is treatment with BPN14770 likely to normalize cAMP levels in all tissues. In brain, PDE4D is only one of three PDE4 subtypes expressed, the others being PDE4A and PDE4B, thus PDE4A, PDE4B and PDE4D all contribute to cAMP homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. At the low dose of BPN14770 used in this study (0.3&#x02009;mg/kg), inhibition is still relatively selective for PDE4D, although the effect of BPN14770 on basal cAMP levels in <italic>fmr1</italic> KO mouse brain should be addressed in future studies.</p><p id="Par20">Chronic dosing of 14 days duration with BPN14770 had broad efficacy across multiple behavioral measures in the <italic>fmr1</italic> mouse model of fragile&#x000a0;X.

As an internal control, there was no effect on the dendritic spines of layer 5 pyramidal cells. Layer 3 pyramidal cells are the principle input neurons for intracortical association while layer 5 pyramidal cells are the principle output cells. The selective effect of BPN14770 on layer 3 pyramidal neurons may be due to the preferential expression of PDE4D in this cortical cell type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Such cells may be more responsive to PDE4D inhibition.

Although pyramidal neurons were not probed in deeper layers of cortex, intracortical association neurons may be more plastic, and in adults, maturation of their dendritic spines may be more responsive to signaling through the PKA-CREB pathway and thereby to inhibition of PDE4D. Consistent with the effect of BPN14770 on cortical neuron structure, the behavioral benefit of BPN14770 endures well after washout of the drug. The half-life of BPN14770 in mice is 11 hr (unpublished data), therefore the enduring behavioral benefit is not due to slow washout of the drug.</p><p id="Par22">These studies were conducted in adult male <italic>fmr1</italic> gene-deleted mice suggesting that adolescent and adult FXS patients may benefit from treatment with a PDE4D-NAM. One of the challenges in the design of clinical efficacy studies in FXS patients is the number of concomitant medications used to reduce symptoms of FXS, their impact on clinical aspects of the disorder that the novel neurotherapeutic may address, and the potential for pharmacokinetic as well as pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions. FXS patients are prescribed multiple classes of psychotropic drugs including, but not limited to, antipsychotics to reduce irritability and aggression, serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) to reduce anxiety, and dopaminergic stimulants to reduce inattention and hyperactivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Younger patients are at higher risk for seizure and may be prescribed anticonvulsants. In contrast, when potential therapeutic agents are evaluated in animal models, either <italic>Dfmr1</italic> mutant flies or <italic>fmr1</italic> mutant mice, the agents are evaluated on a &#x0201c;clean&#x0201d; background in the absence of other psychotropic drugs.

Although SSRIs provide some control of anxiety in FXS patients, concomitant administration of an SSRI and a second drug that elevates cAMP may reduce the likelihood of discerning clinical benefit of the new agent on measures of anxiety or on clinical global impression scales incorporating anxiety in a composite measure.</p><p id="Par23">In addition to FXS, there is a clear link between other monogenic disorders associated with intellectual disability and aberrant cAMP signaling through activation of PKA and consequent phosphorylation of the cAMP response element binding factor (CREB).

Difference maps were constructed by subtraction of raw distributions (control subtracted from target) as in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. A 12-category classification scheme that describes highly granulated dendritic spine phenotypes was used to categorize every spine (Sup Fig. 8 &#x00026; 9). These categories were collapsed into three categories representing immature, intermediate, and mature spine morphologies (Sup Fig. 8 &#x00026; 9). Finally, an assessment independent from the 12-point scheme was used to describe classic spine phenotypes (e.g. mushroom, stubby, etc.).</p><p id="Par46">All Afraxis experimenters were fully blinded to treatment conditions during the collection, assembly, and interpretation of the data. The database was locked after all spine data was collected prior to unblinding by treatment for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Statistical Analysis of Spine Morphometry</title><p id="Par47">Values are reported in tables and plots as group means&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard errors of the mean (SEMs) where each data value (individual mouse) represents the mean value of all segments sampled from a given mouse. For all group comparisons of parametric values, statistical significance was determined using the analysis of variance test (ANOVA; SPSS). Post-hoc comparisons were assessed using the Student&#x02019;s t-test (2-tailed). For the spine analysis, non-parametric comparisons of individual measure population distributions were conducted using the 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0001).</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Data Availability</title><p id="Par48">The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec22"><p>
