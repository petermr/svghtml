using an exercise program with Nintendo and the Balance Board peripheral in subjects with
cerebral palsy. [Subjects and Methods] This study included 4 male outpatients of a
neurological center. All participants received an exercise program based on the use of
Nintendo with the Balance Board peripheral. Training consisted of three 25-min sessions
per week for 6 weeks. Each session was guided by a physical therapist. Timed up-and-go and
one-leg standing tests were conducted before and after the intervention. [Results] All
subjects showed significant improvements in the results of the timed up-and-go test.
However, there were no significant changes in the results of the one-leg standing test.
[Conclusion] The exercise protocol involving Nintendo with the Balance Board peripheral
appears to improve functional dynamic balance in patients with cerebral palsy. However,
static functional balance does not improve after 6 weeks of training.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Nintendo Wii</kwd><kwd>Functional balance</kwd><kwd>Cerebral palsy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Children with cerebral palsy (CP) show limited postural control due to injury to the
central nervous system in the developing brain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In fact, poor balance control is known to be a major constraint in
functional activities of daily living such as standing or walking, in which good functional
balance is required in both static and dynamic positions<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Innovative alternatives have been suggested to improve balance control in people with and
those without neurological diseases<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nintendo with the Balance Board peripheral
(NWBB) has been postulated as a tool to improve functional performance, hand skills, gait,
and balance<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. NWBB is a low-cost,
attractive, and user-friendly therapeutic tool, which makes it an excellent choice for
environments with limited resources<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A previous study employed an NWBB training program over 4 weeks, 2 hours per week,
integrating different sensory inputs and reported an improvement in the postural stability
(symmetrical weight distribution) in 4 children with spastic CP<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another NWBB protocol, which consisted of 4 weekly sessions
of 25&#x02005;min over 3 weeks in 14 children with spastic hemiplegia CP showed a significant
increase in balance using the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOT-2)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Finally, Tarakci et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> showed functional balance improvement in 14
children with CP after 12 weeks of training with Wii Fit for 2 sessions of 40&#x02005;min each
week.</p><p>Despite the above-mentioned studies, there are no reports of CP treated with NWBB to
improve static and dynamic balance in the Latino population. Therefore, the objective of the
current study was to explore the possibility of improving functional balance using an
exercise program with NWBB in Latino subjects with CP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Four male outpatients participated in this pilot study. The inclusion criteria were (1) age
between 8 and 16&#x02005;years, (2) diagnosis of spastic hemiparesis CP or spastic diparesis CP, and
(3) level I or II in the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and the Expanded
and Revised Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS-ER). This study excluded
subjects with an average mean score &#x0003c;80, indicating cognitive impairment, as assessed by
full-scale intelligence quotient, epilepsy, previous surgeries in the lower limb over the
last 2&#x02005;years, and associated disabilities diagnosed by a neurologist such as uncorrected
visual or vestibular impairment. Subjects had no other training during the study period.</p><p>Written consent was obtained from all participants. This research study was approved by the
Bioethics Committee of the Universidad de Talca (ref. no. 00068).</p><p>The intervention was performed in an outpatient neurologic rehabilitation center in the
city of Talca, Chile. The NWBB (Wii Fit Plus, Nintendo Co., Japan) training sessions lasted
25&#x02005;min each and were conducted 3 times per week over 6 weeks (7.5 hours). The treatment
setting was a room in which the game image was projected onto a screen on a 2 &#x000d7; 1.5&#x02005;m white
wall. Each participant was located 1.5&#x02005;m away.</p><p>The protocol included 3 sets of exercises; manual and verbal guidance was provided in the
first 2 weeks, and in the following weeks, only verbal instructions were provided by a
physical therapist. The exercises conducted were Snowboard, Penguin Slide, and Super Hula
Hoop for the first 2 series of exercises and the Yoga game for the third series. In the
first series, subjects stood with their arms and hands at their sides in a relaxed manner.
In the second series, each game was repeated in a standing position and with the subjects&#x02019;
hands on their waist. In the third series, the subjects maintained their posture as relaxed
as possible with their eyes open and later with their eyes closed<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study considered 2 functional assessments of balance: timed up-and-go (TUG) test for
dynamic balance<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> and one-leg standing
(TOLS) test for static balance<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Before
the TOLS evaluation, a dominance assessment was performed for the diparesis CP. The dominant
leg was defined as the leg preferred for kicking a ball. For hemiparesis measurement, TOLS
was performed in the affected lower limb. Measures were taken before and after the
intervention in the Human Motor Control Laboratory of the University of Talca during the
morning, on the same day, and under the same conditions.</p><p>The initial measurement considered baseline subject characteristics such as age, weight,
height, and body mass index.</p><p>Descriptive statistics are presented for TUG and TOLS for each case in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Subject</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age<break/>(years)</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight<break/>(kg)</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height<break/>(cm)</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI<break/>(kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GMFCS/GMFCS-ER<break/>(level)</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type CP</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">165</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.08</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">II</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Right spastic hemiparesis</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">45</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">148</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.54</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">I</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spastic diparesis</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">157</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.80</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">II</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spastic diparesis</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">145</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.83</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">I</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Right spastic hemiparesis</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>GMFCS: Gross Motor Function Classification System; GMFCS-ER: Expanded and Revised

functional balance. A previous study on TUG and TOLS assessment showed that training 2 times
per week for 12 weeks was effective in improving balance, but the sample was more
heterogeneous (7 diplegic, 5 hemiplegic, and 2 dyskinetic) and had greater motor impairment
(GMFMCS-ER 4 and 5) than the sample in this study<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although the CP subjects of this research were GMFCS levels I and II, these results are in
agreement with previous research<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such
agreement indicates that NWBB benefits are not limited and/or related to those conditions.
Additionally, Mombarg et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> showed an
improvement in balance after 6 weeks of training with NWBB in 29 children with poor motor
performance.</p><p>Another study demonstrated that NWBB gaming improves the balance control assessed with
BOT-2<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The BOT-2 is a game-like test,
which it encourages use by children<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Similarly, TUG is a dynamic test that involves walking speed, in addition to standing and
sitting. From this perspective, TUG can be considered a game-like test, unlike the TOLS
test, which can affect the motivation of participants. This would explain why TOLS showed no
significant changes in this study.</p><p>The data obtained in this study suggest that the effects of training with NWBB on
functional balance are conditioned by the various characteristics of each subject, such as
their topographic diagnosis and age, the latter because age is linked to the maturation of
sensory systems in charge of postural control<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of the dynamic functional balance test (TUG) were due to the topographic
compromise presented by each subject. Those subjects who achieved a higher improvement over
their baseline performance were those with right hemiparesis, because motor impairment in
these subjects is less than in diparesis spastic subjects.</p><p>Another important aspect of the TUG results is the age of the subjects; those who had the
largest reduction in the time were 16 and 14&#x02005;years old. The literature explains that the
first system to be calibrated at the age of 3&#x02013;4&#x02005;years is the somatosensory system,
consisting of mechanoreceptors and proprioceptors, followed by the visual system at
approximately 7&#x02013;12&#x02005;years. Finally, the vestibular system is calibrated at approximately
16&#x02005;years of age. Consequently, it is likely that the sensory systems (visual, vestibular,
and somatosensory) contributing to postural balance were more developed in the older
subjects included in this study.</p><p>The TOLS results showed that two 9-year-old subjects increased their time by the largest
amount. When the subject is in a developmental stage, the NWBB training probably facilitates
the phenomenon of brain plasticity<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, which
favors the generation of motor patterns to maintain the unipodal position longer.</p><p>Human balance does refer to a particular/stationary position, but a complex process
involving several factors as the support base. In the TOLS test, there is less support base,
and since the person is supported on only one foot, it requires greater postural control to
correct the forces that interact in the body. However, in the TUG test, the functional
activity of walking has a greater support base. Therefore, a smaller improvement in TOLS is
not surprising.</p><p>The results of this exploratory study support its aim: a training protocol with NWBB
prescribed and guided by physical therapists can improve functional balance in Latino
subjects with CP. However, static functional balance does not improve after 6 weeks of
training. Future studies should complement the assessment of clinical tests with a force
platform or other instrumental measures.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lorentzen</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Greve</surname><given-names>LZ</given-names></name><name><surname>Kliim-Due</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Twenty weeks of home-based interactive training of
