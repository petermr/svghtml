functional balance in non-faller elderly practitioners of Tai Chi. [Subjects and Methods]
For the study, nine non-faller elderly practitioners of Tai Chi who were able to maintain
a standing posture and walk independently were recruited. Timed one-leg standing and timed
up-and-go tests were used as functional balance tests and force platform to measure the
center of pressure. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for the timed
up-and-go/timed one-leg standing test scores and center of pressure parameter values.
[Results] None of the correlations was statistically significant, but moderate
correlations were observed between the pairs timed one-leg standing/sway area of center of
pressure, timed one-leg standing/standard deviation of center of pressure in the
mediolateral direction, timed one-leg standing/mean velocity of center of pressure in the
anteroposterior direction, and timed up-and-go test sway area of center of pressure.
[Conclusion] Timed one-leg standing is more appropriate than timed up-and-go test for the
measurement of functional balance in non-faller elderly practitioners of Tai Chi.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Functional assessment</kwd><kwd>Older adults</kwd><kwd>Center of pressure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Postural instability is a major risk factor of falling in the elderly. In this context,
balance disorders observed during aging have a significant impact on the functional
independence and quality of life of aged adults<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. For physical therapists, it is
relevant to maintain or improve motor function as long as possible. Several interventions
have been proposed to achieve this aim, one of them being Tai Chi, which has shown a
positive impact on the balance of the elderly population<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, although a greater proportion of practitioners do it for
recreational purposes.</p><p>Motor function may be assessed by using different strategies, including clinical and
instrumental assessments. Among the clinical functional tests are the timed one-leg standing
(TOLS)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> and timed up-and-go (TUG)
tests<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The TOLS test is a functional
test that evaluates static stability<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. It
is considered potentially useful for predicting functional decline and is shown to be
sensitive to clinical intervention changes. The TUG test assesses gait-related activities
that involve dynamic stability<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. It
involves rising from a chair, walking 3 m, turning, walking back, and sitting down again.
The task thus corresponds to activities regularly encountered in daily life. Both tests
involve time as a measurement parameter; however, the time taken may not be a relevant
criterion for the accurate assessment of static or dynamic stability<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, as balance control declines gradually with
aging<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, current clinical tools are not
sensitive enough to detect early stage impairments in the elderly<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Other instrumented measurements are costlier and difficult to acquire by clinical centers;
however, they provide greater accuracy of measurements of postural parameters that may
affect dynamic or static stability. Postural control is usually assessed by the
interpretation of parameters derived from the center of pressure (COP), such as velocity and
area of COP displacement (COP<sub>Sway</sub>)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The velocity of the COP describes the neuromuscular response to
shifts in the body&#x02019;s center of mass and serves as an indicator of stability. The mean
velocity of the COP has high reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient &#x0003e;0.8) as a
measurement parameter during standing balance and is sensitive to changes in age-related
postural impairment<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However,
significant increases in other COP parameter values in the elderly are recognized as signs
of postural impairment. In this sense, the mediolateral and anteroposterior components also
show changes related to the impairment of postural control in the elderly<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Both tests are interesting in their predictive capacity for the general function and
stability of the elderly, and are widely used by clinicians to detect a possible risk of
falls in this age group<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, knowledge is lacking about the correlation between these
clinical tests and instrumented measurements (COP parameters) in elderly practitioners of
Tai Chi, which could change how the functional balance of this group is assessed. Thus, the
aim of this study was to determine the correlation between COP and functional balance in
non-faller elderly practitioners of Tai Chi Chuan (NFEPTC).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Nine NFEPTC who could maintain a standing posture and walk independently were recruited for
this study. The study sample was obtained from the Tai Chi Chuan Centre for Older Adults.
Elderly practitioners with a Mini Mental State Examination score of &#x0003c;17 points were
excluded. This research was approved by the ethical committee of the Universidad de Talca,
Chile (2014-VG), in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.
All participants were informed of the experimental procedures and signed an informed consent
form prior to the experiment.</p><p>All the participants practiced Tai Chi Chuan for &#x0003e;4&#x02005;years at a frequency of 3 times per
week for at least 60 minutes each time. The sessions were provided by a trainer certified to
conduct trainings in Tai Chi Chuan. The characteristics of all the participants were
recorded, including age, gender, weight, height, and body mass index.</p><p>The TOLS and TUG<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> tests were conducted the clinical tests, and the standing balance
test on a force plate was conducted as the laboratory test. In the TOLS test, the time (in
seconds) for which the patient was able to maintain a standing position on the dominant foot
was considered in order to assess the static balance of the subject<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The TUG test measured the time (in seconds) it takes for a
person to make a route (3 m) that goes from the sitting position to standing and sitting
again<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Laboratory measurements (COP parameters) were obtained with a force plate (AMTI OR67,
Advanced Mechanical Technologies Inc., Boston, MA, USA). The COP parameters were as follows:
COP<sub>Sway</sub>, standard deviation of the COP in the mediolateral (SD<sub>ML</sub>)
and anteroposterior (SD<sub>AP</sub>) directions, and mean velocity of the COP in both
directions (<italic>V</italic><sub>ML</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>AP</sub>). The AMTI
NetForce (Advanced Mechanical Technologies Inc., Boston, MA, USA) software was used for the
acquisition.</p><p>Low-pass and second-order Butterworth filters were used with a cutoff frequency of 40&#x02005;Hz,
and COP displacements were recorded at a sampling rate of 200&#x02005;Hz during the &#x0201c;open eyes&#x0201d; (OE)
condition. In the OE condition, the subject stared at a target on a wall located 1.5&#x02005;m away.
This condition was repeated three times for each participant and averaged for analysis.
MATLAB R2012 (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) was used for data processing. In all the
tests, a physical therapist ensured the patient&#x02019;s safety.</p><p>Means and standard deviations were obtained for the demographic and anthropometric
characteristics. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to estimate the
correlation between the clinical test scores (TOLS and TUG) and the COP parameter values.
IBM-SPSS 20.00 was used (SPSS Inc., IL, USA), and the level of significance was set at
p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The characteristics of the nine participants expressed in means and standard deviations

TOLS test scores. This could be explained by the relative complexity of the motor sequence
involved in the TUG test, during which participants have to understand the correct flow of
actions<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> with respect to the TOLS
test. This is an important fact because a recent systematic review revealed that the TUG
test is widely used (over the TOLS test) in the assessment of Tai Chi Chuan practitioners&#x02019;
functional balance<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similar to those of
other research studies<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, the present
findings suggest that the TUG test is not adequate to measure balance, considering the low
correlations with the COP parameter values, except for COP<sub>Sway</sub>.</p><p>Research has shown that the displacement of the COP in the mediolateral and anteroposterior
directions is sensitive to changes in age in the elderly<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In line with this, the
TOLS test scores showed moderate correlations with the SD<sub>ML</sub> and
<italic>V</italic><sub>AP</sub> values; therefore, the TOLS test is more suitable than the
TUG test for measuring functional balance.</p><p>In contrast, previous research has shown greater correlations between TOLS test scores and
COP parameter values<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, but that research
included elderly subjects who were nonpractitioners of Tai Chi. This fact suggests that the
TOLS test is less adequate in measuring functional balance in NFEPTC than in
nonpractitioners of Tai Chi. However, the fact that the TUG and TOLS tests could not be
applied specifically for the elderly population should be considered, as the gait speed test
(GST)<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, further research is
necessary in order to assess balance with tests such as the GST.</p><p>The limited sample size in the present study has to be considered. Despite the moderate
correlations found in this study, none of these correlations was statistically significant.
Certainly, the main reason for this was the small sample size. In fact, the correlations
have to be &#x0003e;0.8 in order to achieve statistical significance. Therefore, a key
recommendation for future studies is to increase the sample size. Another limitation is the
heterogeneity of the sample, especially in terms of age. This could act as an effect
modifier variable, considering that correlations would differ between subjects aged 60 and
80&#x02005;years.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the present data offer insights for future clinical assessment
of elderly practitioners of Tai Chi Chuan. These findings routed further research, which
would be interesting if a control group (i.e., healthy elderly nonpractitioners of Tai Chi)
were incorporated for comparison between the clinical tests and the laboratory measurements
(force platform). In summary, the clinical assessment of functional balance showed moderate
and low correlations with the COP parameters in the NFEPTC. Therefore, the TOLS test is more
appropriate than the TUG test for measuring balance in this population.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Ambrose</surname><given-names>AF</given-names></name><name><surname>Cruz</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Paul</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Falls and fractures: a systematic approach to screening
