Platelets not only represent an important reservoir of growth factors and angiogenic regulators, they are also known to participate in the tumor microenvironment implicated in tumor growth and dissemination. Herein, we investigated if diabetic concentrations of metformin could impinge upon the previously reported observation that platelet induces an increase in the tube forming capacity of endothelial cells (angiogenesis) and upon ovarian cancer cell aggressiveness. We demonstrate that metformin inhibits the increase in angiogenesis brought about by platelets in a mechanism that did not alter endothelial cell migration. In ovarian cancer cell lines and primary cultured cancer cells isolated from the ascitic fluid of ovarian cancer patients, we assessed the effect of combinations of platelets and metformin upon angiogenesis, migration, invasion and cancer sphere formation. The enhancement of each of these parameters by platelets was abrogated by the present of metformin in the vast majority of cancer cell cultures tested. Neither metformin nor platelets altered proliferation; however, metformin inhibited the increase in phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase induced by platelets. We present the first evidence suggesting that concentrations of metformin present in diabetic patients may reduce the actions of platelets upon both endothelial cells and cancer cell survival and dissemination.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>thrombocytosis</kwd><kwd>hemostasis</kwd><kwd>EA.hy926</kwd><kwd>SKOV3</kwd><kwd>UCI101</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women and the most lethal gynecologic malignancy [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thrombocytosis, high platelets counts, is observed in 10&#x02013;57% of patients with cancer, which is prevalent in ovarian cancer, and been correlated with poor prognosis [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Approximately one-third of women with recently diagnosed ovarian cancer have platelet counts exceeding 450,000/&#x003bc;L [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Furthermore, thrombocytosis is associated with several aggressive clinical features including, increased median preoperative serum CA-125 levels, advanced-stage disease and significantly decreased progression-free and overall survival (2.62 years compared with 4.65 years in those without thrombocytosis) [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Platelets has a fundamental role in hemostasis and coagulation [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Platelets are cytoplasmic fragments lacking a nucleus, which derive from the fragmentation of their precursor cells, megakaryocytes. As summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, it has been widely reported that activated platelets can act directly upon the endothelium to promote angiogenesis and act upon the cancer cell to contributes to tumor-promoted angiogenesis, tumor-development and metastasis [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Platelet activation can occur upon the binding of cell surface agonists such as thrombin [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] or the removal of platelets from their environment, which contains activation inhibitors such as prostaglandins [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Platelet activation leads to aggregation, exposure of membrane proteins and release the content of their granules, which in the case of tumor cells is implicated in the promotion of angiogenesis, growth, survival and metastasis [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> murine models it has been shown that platelets participate in cancer development and protect tumor cells in circulation from elimination by the immune system [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In a previous work, we showed that platelets could act as chemoattractants to cancer cells, increase the expression of metastasis initiating cell markers and enhance cancer sphere formation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These influences may enable tumor cells to arrest in the vasculature, mediate an inflammatory response produced by the interaction of platelets with the tumor microenvironment and thus favor proliferation and angiogenesis [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Actions of platelets upon the processes of angiogenesis and tumor promotion</title><p>Platelets acting directly upon endothelial cells have been reported to enhance the formation of tubular structures and the process of angiogenesis.

Its primary action is to inhibit hepatic glucose production, but it also increases the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. To date, several epidemiological studies indicate that the use of metformin in patients with cancer would be beneficial, especially observed in an increase in disease-free survival [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These studies initiated the scientific interest in determining the mechanism of action by which metformin delivers anti-cancer benefits. Habitual clinical dosing regimens of metformin hydrochloride tablets generally result in steady state plasma concentrations of less than 1 mg/mL, which are achieved within 24 to 48 hours (U.S. Food &#x00026; Drug Administration). During controlled clinical studies of metformin, maximum plasma metformin levels do not exceed 5 mg/mL (30 &#x003bc;mol/L). Furthermore, it has been reported that the maximum plasmatic concentration in diabetic patients is within a range of 1-4 mg/ml, which corresponds to 6&#x02013;24 &#x003bc;M respectively (U.S. Food &#x00026; Drug Administration). Furthermore, Lalau and colleagues showed that the mean + standard deviation plasma concentrations were 2.7 &#x000b1; 7.3 mg/L (16 &#x000b1; 44 &#x003bc;mol/L) in a total of 467 patients [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the concentrations used in most published <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are several times higher than maximum plasma concentrations that would be achieved with the doses of metformin used by diabetic patients [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, the currently published mechanism of action may help promote use of high dose of metformin as a stand-alone cancer treatment, however these mechanisms may not necessarily explain why diabetic concentrations have beneficial effects on cancer incidence and survival [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Currently, few studies are available regarding the effects that would have metformin on platelet function. Several studies indicate that in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, metformin would be beneficial in maintaining hemostasis in these patients [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Several years ago, the effect of platelet function in the presence of metformin was determined, in response to different stimuli, including adrenaline and ADP. Authors observed that the presence of metformin decreases platelet function (aggregation) in response only to the combined stimulus of ADP and adrenaline, but not against simple stimuli [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A recent trial [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] has documented that metformin decreased mean platelet volume (MPV), which is known to be increased in diabetes mellitus and has been correlated with vascular complications [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Our published results have shown that the use of metformin in concentrations approved for use in diabetics (micromolar range) has no effect on cell proliferation, but can allow ovarian cancer cells to overcome resistance to carboplatin [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, in a previous publication we demonstrated that platelets could promote cell migration, EMT and sphere formation in cultures of ovarian cancer [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Given the increasing literature suggesting that metformin could have beneficial effects upon ovarian cancer patients and that metformin can modify platelet function, we speculate that the use of micromolar concentrations of metformin alone would not have significant effects on angiogenesis, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, but may abrogate platelet-mediated progression of ovarian cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Metformin inhibits the increase of endothelial tube formation induced by platelets but does not inhibit platelet-enhanced endothelial cell migration</title><p>Publications have demonstrated that platelet interaction with the endothelium promotes the process of angiogenesis (upper panel of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In this study we utilized platelets at concentrations of 150,000 platelets//&#x003bc;L extracted from healthy volunteers. Although this is a physiological concentration, this quantity of platelets directly in contact with endothelial cells (and further on in this study with cancer cells) within the area of the cell culture dish represents a situation that would only be observed in thrombocytosis. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> we confirm that platelets can notably and statistically increase the formation of capillary-like structures in matrigel (hereafter referred to as angiogenesis). We assessed the ability of metformin (20 micromolar) to antagonize this platelet increase in angiogenesis. The co-addition of metformin abrogates this effect, as confirmed in both the endothelial cell line EA.hy926 and in primary cultured Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC). As the process of angiogenesis is known to require endothelial cell migration, we assessed if metformin was inhibiting changes in migration induced by platelets. The scratch assay presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> shows that metformin did not significantly alter the platelet-increased migration of these endothelial cells.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Metformin abrogates the platelet-increased formation of capillary-like structures in matrigel (angiogenesis)</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) EA.hy926 cells and HUVEC were seeded onto matrigel and incubated in the presence of control (vehicle), Metformin (20 &#x003bc;M), Platelets (150,000/ &#x003bc;L) and Metformin (20 uM) plus Platelets (150,000/ &#x003bc;L) for 12 hrs.

To this end, ovarian cancer cells were co-cultured with platelets in the presence or absence of metformin in the absence of serum. After 24 hours the now conditioned media was removed and used to evaluate (cancer cell promoted) angiogenesis in EA.hy926 cells. As observed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> and shown statistically in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, platelets increased the balance of pro-angiogenic factors released from both the SKOV3 and UCI101 ovarian cancer cell lines and this was prevented by the presence of metformin. It cannot be determined at the present time is there is an increase in pro-angiogenic factors released by cancer cells or a decrease in anti-angiogenic factors, thus we refer to an increase in the pro-angiogenic balance. A 24-hour incubation of platelets in culture medium in the absence of cancer cells did not significantly increase angiogenesis, demonstrating that the increase in the balance of pro-angiogenic factors originated from the cancer cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).

Despite these clinical observations, the underlying mechanisms of how metformin could be beneficial to cancer patients are poorly defined. Herein, by demonstrating an antagonism of platelet action we shed light on how metformin may reduce endothelial-originated angiogenesis and biological activities associated with cancer progression.</p><sec id="s3_1"><title>Platelets and metformin upon the endothelial cell (non-cancerous setting)</title><p>In addition to the known effects on glucose metabolism, metformin has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory role in polycystic ovary syndrome, while possessing anti-proliferative actions upon vasculature smooth muscle cells [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Metformin has been reported to decrease the release of pro-angiogenic factors in polycystic ovary syndrome, as well as decreasing VEGF levels in obese diabetic patients [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Using an air pouch model the authors of the latter mentioned study reported that metformin decreases angiogenesis by 34% in rat granulomatous tissue and further demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> that metformin decreases levels of VEGF mRNA and migration of HUVEC cells[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, in our <italic>in vitro</italic> models of an endothelial cell line and primary cultured endothelial cells we observed no effect of micromolar concentrations of metformin on the process of angiogenesis.</p><p>The association between platelets and the process of angiogenesis has been reported <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our results confirm the role of platelets in the induction of capillary-like formation of networks in HUVEC cells, and we demonstrate herein that this also occurs in the endothelial EA.hy926 cell line. Additionally, we found that platelets increase endothelial cell migration. We report for the first time that metformin can directly abrogate the <italic>in vitro</italic> angiogenesis induced by platelets, while having no effect on basal or platelet enhanced endothelial cell migration. A possibility is that metformin acts directly upon the platelets to reduces the release of pro-angiogenic factors. It has been reported previously that upon their activation, platelets are capable of releasing and exposing on their surface to both pro-and anti-angiogenic factors depending on the activation stimulus. For example, when platelets are stimulated with ADP they release VEGF, a pro-angiogenic factor of excellence, without releasing endostatin. Upon stimulation with thromboxane A2, platelets can release endostatin in the absence of VEGF, and thus mediate an anti-angiogenic stimulus in HUVEC cells [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although extensive further studies need to be performed, we feel that an exclusive effect of metformin upon the platelets is unlikely as platelet activation occurs when platelets come into contact culture medium (platelets become activated once they are removed from inhibitory factors present in plasma). Herein, we suggest that the inhibitory action of metformin is brought about by the modification of internal signaling pathways in the endothelial cell that respond to platelet stimulation. Metformin is known to signal through the AMPK pathway, however an important observation of this result is that the co-addition of compound C and platelets did not alter the action of platelets, indicating that the action of AMPK is not required for platelet activation or platelet-increased angiogenesis. However, it is still not clear if AMPK phosphorylation is required for the metformin inhibition of platelet action. As mentioned in the results section, in endothelial cell cultures we failed to see reproducible increases in AMPK phosphorylation or that of its downstream target ACC-1 in the presence of micromolar metformin. However, the compound C inhibitor does reproducibly inhibit millimolar metformin action. There are several explanations for this. Firstly AMPK phosphorylation may be occurring but below the levels of detection of the Western blots. However, distinguishing the literature of micromolar metformin from millimolar metformin, there are few publications reporting an increase in AMPK phosphorylation with micromolar metformin and thus the possibility exists that micromolar metformin effects its actions though an alternative pathway [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. While compound C (dorsomorphin) is extensively reported to block the AMPK inhibition-independent blockade of mTOR pathway, it is also reported to be a selective inhibitor of BMP type I receptors ALK2, ALK3 and ALK6 and furthermore an activator of the MEK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Future experiments will determine the exact mechanisms of micromolar metformin action upon the endothelium and the internal signal transduction pathways used by compound C to blunt the response to platelets.</p></sec><sec id="s3_2"><title>The platelet-cancer cell interaction and metformin: angiogenesis</title><p>The association between platelets and the process of tumor angiogenesis has been recognized [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The role of platelets in the regulation of angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> was first documented in a cornea angiogenesis model, in which platelets were shown to support angiogenesis and prevent leakage, and hemorrhage from the newly formed vessels [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

However, other studies have shown that metformin exerts other effects beyond those on glucose metabolism, as by example to modulate inflammation in polycystic ovary syndrome [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and to exert antiproliferative actions specially in cancer cells [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These observations have expanded the range of actions of this drug that may explain several improvements not associated with its anti-hyperglycemic action [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Xavier et al., [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] studied the effects of systemic treatment of metformin in the sponge model to evaluate its actions on early steps of the formation of the fribrovascular tissue. They found that metformin has a regulatory function on components of inflammatory angiogenesis, attenuating vascularization.</p><p>In the present study, we observed that the addition of platelets to ovarian cancer cells brought about an increase in the balance of pro-angiogenic factors, as demonstrated by the formation of capillary-like structures upon co-incubation of the resulting conditioned medium (removed at 24 hours) with endothelial cells on matrigel. The coincubation of platelets in solely culture medium for the same period before incubation with endothelial cells did not result in changes in angiogenesis, most likely due to the short half-life of the growth factors released by platelets. Interestingly, the presence of metformin reduced this angiogenic potential in both cell lines tested and three of the four cultures of cancer cells isolated from the ascites of high-grade serous papillary ovarian cancer. In one culture, metformin did not reduce platelet-increased angiogenesis. While in the sphere forming assays and the migration assay we clearly see an effect of metformin upon the cancer cell (inhibiting the platelet-effect of the latter two processes) we cannot fully rule out the possibility that Metformin remains in the conditioned medium and thus inhibits angiogenesis by a direct effect upon endothelial cells. However, an anti-angiogenic effect of metformin occurring only upon endothelial cells is unlikely as patient number 4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) showed no effect in the presence of metformin despite the same endothelial cells being used. In other words, if the action of metformin is only upon the endothelial cells, there would be no reason for metformin not to inhibit the platelet-increase in angiogenesis observed in this patient. Possibly, platelets may increase a different milieu of pro-angiogenic factors in each individual cancer and this increase in inhibited or not by metformin. The observation that metformin did not have the same effect on all primary cancer cultures is to be expected as we now know that each cancer is unique, each having specific mutations which alter the responses to external stimuli. Thus, as we have seen throughout oncology treatment, it is difficult to generalize a response to a particular treatment and if metformin is to be used effectively in future cancer treatments, a biomarker to predict response may have to be found. As a further demonstration of the uniqueness of each cancer, as expected the baseline levels of angiogenesis varied for each primary culture (compare controls in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), however the presence of platelets increased angiogenesis in each situation.</p></sec><sec id="s3_3"><title>The platelet-cancer cell interaction and metformin: migration and invasion</title><p>In another assessment of cancer aggressiveness, metformin abrogated platelet-increased migration in both ovarian cancer cell lines and very strikingly in a primary culture (patient 5) despite having no effect on this same process in endothelial cells (please refer to Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Despite this inhibition of migration, metformin did not alter the invasion increased by platelets. It is noteworthy that metformin did not alter basal levels of migration and thus cells still have the ability to migrate in the presence of metformin. We can speculate that this basal migratory activity is sufficient for invasion and those platelets increases the proteins (e.g. metalloproteases) involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix via a signaling pathway not altered by metformin.</p><p>Interestingly, with respect to migration there is a differing action of metformin upon endothelial cell and the cancer cell. This differing action was further highlighted when we examined the action of the AMPK inhibitor compound C upon the cancer cells. Unlike the endothelial cells, the inhibition of the AMPK pathway abolished the migratory and angiogenic capacities of the cancer cells (data not shown). This may suggest that cancer cells are heavily reliant on the AMPK pathway and possibly its role in autophagy for survival. Whether metformin exerts its effects in cancer cells through AMPK is still the subject of ongoing investigation, however, alternative pathways to the effect of compound C have been reported [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, central to the process of migration in cancer cells is the regulation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) protein [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. FAK phosphorylation was observed under basal conditions, however co-incubation of platelets with ovarian cancer cell lines increased significantly FAK phosphorylation and this was inhibited by metformin. In accordance with our findings, an effect of metformin, albeit together with the antibiotic Salinomycin, on FAK has been previously reported in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. In NSCLC the combination of both of these compounds reduced the phoshorylation of FAK as well as &#x003b2;-catenin, Src and Chk-2 [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In a recent paper it was observed that FAK was present in platelets and was involved in their migration into the tumor [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, in our experiments the levels of FAK in platelets were barely detectable in comparison to levels observed in the tumor cells. Furthermore, the platelets were washed before cancer protein harvesting and thus the increase in FAK phosphorylation observed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref> corresponds to FAK within the tumor cell. Although results lean towards metformin delivering its anti-platelet action upon the cancer cells, it is still not clear if metformin alters the nature of platelet activation or platelet cancer cell interaction. These extensive experiments are ongoing and will constitute a separate publication, however, hypothesizing that the anti-platelet action occurs through modification of intercellular pathways in the cancer cell, we can speculate that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated by metformin as previously demonstrated [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The Unc-51-like kinase 1 (Ulk1) is known to be phosphorylated by AMPK and this protein is reported to form a stable complex with FAK-family interacting protein of 200 kDa (FIP 200) and thus recruiting FAK in its unphosphorylated form [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. As mentioned, whether metformin via AMPK activation prevents FAK phosphorylation through its incorporation into the Ulk1-FIP200 complex is currently under investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3_4"><title>The platelet-cancer cell interaction and metformin: cancer spheres</title><p>Cancer spheres or spheroids are present in the ascitic fluid of ovarian cancer patients, and these are believed to be the key in both chemoresistance and the formation of metastasis [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In our previous publications, we demonstrated that platelets are capable of increasing the formation of cancer spheres in ovarian cancer cells [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Herein, along with increased sphere number, we further demonstrate that platelets can increase the average diameter of these spheres and showed that their formation was inhibited in the presence of metformin. This may have favorable clinical consequences, as metformin may potentially block both the formation of metastasis initiating cells (MICs) in the primary tumor and the formation of cancer spheres or aggregates of MICs in circulation. However, while an inhibition of sphere formation was observed in the UCI101 cell line and in a patient sample, no such effect occurred in SKOV3, reaffirming that cancer biology remains complex, even in established cell lines.

The membranes were washed two times for five minutes in TBS-T buffer, incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Biorad, Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L)-HRP Conjugate; Cat. N&#x000b0;170-6515, USA) for two hours at room temperature and developed with chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce ECL Thermo Scientific, Whaltman, MA, USA). Membranes were exposed to MyECL (Thermo Scientific, Whaltman, MA, USA) and equal protein loading was initially assessed with Ponceau-S red staining (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The integrated optical density of bands was quantitated using the Image J v.1.6 software. The optical densities were expressed as the ratio of treatment/control.</p></sec><sec id="s4_8"><title>Invasion assay</title><p>Briefly, transwell inserts containing membranes with 8 &#x003bc;m pore size (Nunc) were coated with matrigel (Cat N&#x000b0; 356231, growth factor reduced matrigel matrix, phenol red free, BD Biosciences) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells (75,000) were spread over the matrigel (1:5) in 200 &#x003bc;l of medium with no serum, and 800 &#x003bc;l of culture medium with 5% of serum was added to the lower chamber. Cell invasion was studied under the effect of platelets, metformin or both. These treatments were added on the lower chamber of the invasion well. For assessing the number of invaded cells, the filters were fixed with PFA for 30 minutes at room temperature and stained with crystal violet. The filters were mounted on cover slides with Kaiser&#x02019;s, glycerin-gelatin (Merck). Each experiment was performed in duplicate and was repeated at least 3 times. The inserts were examined using a microscope (Nikon Eclipse E200) with attached camera; photographs of 10 fields at 40X, were obtained per insert, and the number of cells in the underside of the filter was counted. Results were expressed as cell number per field, corresponding to the average of the cells photographed for the correspondent treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4_9"><title>Ovarian cancer sphere formation assay</title><p>Ovarian cancer sphere formation assay was performed as previously described by Orellana et al., 2015 [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Briefly, 200,000 ovarian cancer cells SKOV3 and UCI101, were cultured with or without 1.5 10<sup>5</sup> platelets/&#x003bc;L / metformin (20 &#x003bc;M), in 6 well low attachment plates (Nunc<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, NY, USA) in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with FGF 50 &#x003bc;g/ml; EGF 0.2 mg/mL; insulin 5 g/ml and 5% of Bovine serum albumin. Images of spheres were taken at 4&#x000d7; and 10&#x000d7; and were counted at day 2, 4 and 6 by microscopy at 10 &#x000d7;, using 17 fields. The number of spheres was around 2-8 per field. In the case of primary cultures spheres, 15,000 cells were cultured in 12-well low attachment plates (Nunc<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, NY, USA) in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with FGF 50 ug/ml; EGF 0.2 mg/ml; insulin 5 g/ml. It should be mentioned that on several occasions, especially after 2 days of culture (data not shown), the co-incubation with platelets of the spheres from cell lines gave rise to large aggregates formed by several spheres trapped within a mesh of platelets. These mesh structures often made quantification difficult and for this reason, quantification was recorded at day 2 of culture.</p></sec><sec id="s4_10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Experiments were one variable was present were analyzed using ANOVA with the Tukey pos<italic>t-test</italic> (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). When two variables were analyzed a two-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni pos<italic>t-test</italic> was utilized (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). All HUVEC and cell line experiments were performed a minimum of three times. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The published literature is now showing an irrefutable distinction between patient-approved pharmaceutical and super pharmaceutical doses of metformin in the field of oncology. These observations reflect the diversity of action of metformin, further emphasizing that there are still many mechanisms of action upon the cancer cell that need to be identified. This study adds further argument that metformin research should be separated into two disciplines. Firstly, the use of concentrations below 50 micromolar would help elucidate how metformin lowers the cancer incidence and improves outcome in patients taking the drug. Secondly, the use of higher (millimolar) concentrations will evaluate if metformin alone, or when incorporated into future cancer therapeutic regimes, could be beneficial to patient outcome.</p><p>We have observed that platelets promote <italic>in vitro</italic> angiogenesis, migration and sphere formation capacity and these processes are inhibited by micromolar metformin, raising the possibility that platelets simply increase cancer cell proliferation, while metformin decreases proliferation. The co-incubation of platelets with ovarian cancer murine cells has been reported to increase cancer cell proliferation [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, in our <italic>in vitro</italic> model we observed no change in proliferation or cell cycle in the presence of platelets. Furthermore, we previously reported that micromolar metformin did not alter the proliferation of SKOV3 or A2780 ovarian cancer cells, which was reaffirmed by Zhang and colleagues [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Herein, we confirm that micromolar concentrations of metformin have no effect in SKOV3 cell proliferation and report that this is also true for UCI101 cells.</p><p>The results presented in this paper show a protective action of metformin upon platelet-mediation processes involved in cancer progression. This may help us to understand the beneficial clinical effects shown by this drug in patients with ovarian cancer. This anti-platelet action of metformin may not just be limited to cancer. Metformin use has been demonstrated to reduce mean platelet mass and volume in patients at risk for atherosclerotic disease [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, in conjunction with positive effects on vascular adhesion, cholesterol levels and inflammatory markers, metformin through the reduction of platelet volume and action may have a role in reducing the development of atherosclerosis. Future investigation will elucidate whether the action of metformin on platelet activity is also relevant in insulin resistance and polycystic ovary syndrome. Herein, we demonstrate that metformin possesses actions that further support the ongoing clinical trials evaluating the inclusion of metformin alongside conventional cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec
