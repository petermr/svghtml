We challenge this idea because a suitable musculoskeletal anatomy is not the only requirement for sustained flapping flight. We propose the &#x0201c;heart to fly&#x0201d; hypothesis that states that sustained flapping flight in modern birds required an enlargement of the heart for the aerobic performance of the flight muscles and test it experimentally by studying tinamous, the living birds with the smallest hearts. The small ventricular size of tinamous reduces cardiac output without limiting perfusion pressures, but when challenged to fly, the heart is unable to support aerobic metabolism (quick exhaustion, larger lactates and post-exercise oxygen consumption and compromised thermoregulation). At the same time, cardiac growth shows a crocodilian-like pattern and is correlated with differential gene expression in MAPK kinases. We integrate this physiological evidence in a new evolutionary scenario in which the ground-up, short and not sustained flapping flight displayed by tinamous represents an intermediate step in the evolution of the aerobic sustained flapping flight of modern birds.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The evolutionary origin of avian flight has been long a matter of scientific debate without unanimous agreement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that powered flight appeared as early as in the most ancient true birds such as <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> but this is controversial because early birds experimented with different airborne gliding or flying behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and the presence of wings and feathers is not necessarily associated with the origin of flight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In modern birds flight is characterized by wing flapping powered by special antagonistic muscles both housed in a ventrally expanded sternum, but the particular skeletal organization of the pectoral girdle responsible for a true flapping flight evolved only in ornithuromorphs and modern birds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. New paleontological and neontological evidence suggest that flapping flight could have evolved in terrestrial birds as a powerful take-off from the ground in a cooperative effort between legs and wings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Ultimately, a sustained flapping flight (SFF) became the successful alternative adopted by birds to be subsequently refined by gliding or hovering. SFF is defined here as the ability to maintain flapping flight aerobically without consequences on other physiological functions.</p><p id="Par3">Sustained flapping flight is an energetically costly activity and the cardiovascular system is of crucial importance to support the elevation in metabolism associated with it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Given that heart mass and maximal metabolic rate scale similarly to body mass, it has been suggested that cardiac size limits maximal aerobic scope and, consequently, maximal metabolism during flight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Therefore, our main argument is that evolutionary modifications in the cardiovascular system would have been critical to support the high aerobic demand of sustained flight and that a suitable musculoskeletal arrangement is not enough to prove the sustained flight capabilities of modern birds. Unfortunately soft tissues fossilize poorly and data on cardiovascular variables cannot be directly measured. Thus, the appearance of flapping flight cannot be unequivocally coupled to sustaining aerobic flight unless the cardiovascular system made it possible.</p><p id="Par4">For this purpose we chose several species from the tinamou family because there is some evidence that they have the smallest heart among birds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, 0.3% of body mass (average from 9 species), which is several times smaller than in phasianids (0.81% as the average relative heart mass from twenty-two species), which is an ecologically convergent group (summarized graphically in Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Tinamous are the only living flying paleognaths, a clade shared with the flightless Ratites (ostriches, emus, rheas, cassowaries and kiwis). In the evolution of Neornithes or &#x0201c;modern birds&#x0201d;, Palaeognathae split from Neognathae (all the other living birds) in the Cretaceous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Tinamous only perform short and burst flapping flights initiated from the ground<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and it has been argued that the small heart limits flight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">We devised our study to evaluate the physiological performance of the heart in tinamous; to confirm and unequivocally document the ontogeny of cardiac growth and its adult morphometry; and to provide evidence of putative gene regulatory pathways involved in the architecture of cardiac size. Therefore, we used two tinamou species from the same genus, the Ornate Tinamou (<italic>Nothoprocta ornata</italic>) found in the Andean Highlands of Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile (altitude range 2500&#x02013;4800&#x02009;m) and the Chilean Tinamou (<italic>Nothoprocta perdicaria</italic>) found in lowland areas in Chile. These species were compared with Red Junglefowl (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>) a neognath species with a larger heart mass but with similar short and burst flapping flights initiated from the ground. We also included data from an outgroup species, the American alligator (<italic>Alligator mississippiensis</italic>) to analyze the comparative ontogeny of cardiac growth. Crocodilians are the only extant non-avian archosaurs and have a typical non-avian reptilian small heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Our hypothesis was that the relative small mass of the heart in tinamous would restrict their aerobic performance and thermoregulatory capacity, and if the small mass of the heart is phylogenetically related to non-avian archosaurian reptiles, the heart of the Red Junglefowl would be comparatively larger during ontogeny. This multi-level and integrated approach intends to explore proximal and ultimate causes for a morphological trait in living birds that has important implications for the interpretation of the evolution of avian flight.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par7">We characterized cardiac growth using power allometric equations (VM&#x02009;=&#x02009;a BM<sup>b</sup> where VM is ventricular mass and BM is body mass) to the data for each species (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The equations differed significantly in the mass exponent between Red Junglefowl and the tinamous and the alligator. For an individual with a body mass of 700&#x02009;g, relative ventricular mass would be 0.21% in the alligator and the Ornate Tinamou, 0.24% in the Chilean Tinamou and significantly larger (0.42%) in the Red Junglefowl. The emerging pattern from the data is that cardiac growth in tinamous and alligators follows a similar trajectory while in Red Junglefowl cardiac growth is increased throughout life. The differences are not apparent during early development and the cardiac growth curves start splitting at a body mass approximately above 80&#x02009;g, which corresponds to an approximate age of 2&#x02013;4 weeks.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Cardiac growth from embryonic age to juvenile or adult age in Red Junglefowl (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>) in red, Chilean Tinamou (<italic>Nothoprocta perdicaria</italic>) in green, Ornate Tinamou (<italic>Nothoprocta ornata</italic>) in blue and American alligator (<italic>Alligator mississippiensis</italic>) in black.

Large increases in lactate are also observed in restrained estuarine crocodiles with slow recoveries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Aerobic metabolism after the exhaustion challenge, the so called post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> was also remarkably long-lasted (60&#x02009;min) for tinamous but almost absent for Red Junglefowl, despite the fact that lactate also increased in the latter. Lactate oxidation is not the main metabolic burden post-exercise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> so the main conclusion from our results is that the larger lactate release and the significant EPOC response reflect that the exhaustion challenge requires an anaerobic contribution that is also considerably longer than what is seen in mammals (17&#x02009;min in sprint wheel running in mice for example<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>). From a comparative point of view, the tinamou EPOC could be considered similar to the response in lizards<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and we infer that the cardiac performance of tinamous closely approximates, in some regards, that of non-avian archosaurs (namely crocodilians) and it may be that this cardiac performance is the ancestral condition for birds.</p><p id="Par20">The aerobic challenge also imposed limitations to the ability to regulate body temperature. Basal cloacal temperatures in the Ornate Tinamou are clearly avian-like albeit on the lower part of the range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Body temperature drops below resting values for a period longer than 2&#x02009;h and the effect is enhanced at lower ambient temperatures. The striking heterothermic swing (rise in body temperature during exhaustion and drop thereafter) is likely magnified by the experimental conditions where the animals could not use behavioral thermoregulation but it was not seen in bantam chickens, which attests to the physiological difference between species. To distinguish if this observation is an adaptive energy-sparing mechanism or a maladaptive consequence of hyperventilation-driven body cooling further studies are needed, but the body temperature of the Ornate Tinamou clearly shows greater variations than chickens and also a larger dependence on ambient temperatures.</p><p id="Par21">It is important to emphasize that the physiological limitations ascribed to a smaller heart mainly apply to challenging scenarios such as the exhaustive bouts of exercise imposed experimentally or the explosive burst of flight experienced in the wild when escaping from potential predators, which could be the most significant aerobic challenges a tinamou is exposed to attending to the EPOC measured<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In resting conditions tinamous are not metabolically challenged and remain thermally stable. The flight performance in tinamous is highly conditioned by their small heart and this could explain why tinamous avoid flying as much as possible. Tinamous prefer to escape from predators walking and running and use their cryptic plumage and secretive habits as the main antipredatory mechanism. When they do not have any other option but flying, they do it in a burst-like manner with a powerful jump. Such flapping flight, normally accompanied with a strident vocalization, can be performed two or three consecutive times before the bird is unable to fly again and it is possible to hand-catch them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.

Note that tinamous need to constantly use cryptic behaviors that restrict their foraging and reproduction niches, they are unable to use flight for migration or dispersion, and they are highly susceptible to predation when exhausted. None of these seems to favor a positive selection pressure for a secondary acquisition of a small heart. Not even the selection pressure of decreased oxygen gradients at altitude triggered cardiac enlargement in high altitude tinamous such as the Ornate Tinamou.</p><p id="Par28">Along the phylogenetic history of birds, the acquisition of a well-developed pectoral musculature (inferred from osteological characters, <italic>i.e</italic>. the progressive increase of the carina in the sternum) has been directly coupled to the capacity for powered flapping and sustained flight, and some authors have even ventured that birds without carina and pectoral musculature such as <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> could have displayed powered flapping flight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Our physiological data does not support the claim that avian species preceding Neornithes would have been capable of sustained flapping flight (SFF).

All the osteological and muscular machinery of tinamous belong to a Neornithine flying bird, but our results show that even in the presence of a big carinated sternum that supports enough pectoral musculature (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), a small heart limits aerobic scope and is not compatible with SFF.</p><p id="Par30">The evolutionary way in which the &#x0201c;modern bird flight&#x0201d; appeared in the avian lineage from archosaurian ancestors has been heavily debated for decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The trees-down flight hypothesis considers that the powered flight capacity was acquired from arboreal gliding animals. In accordance with this point of view flapping flight would have preceded the ability to initiate flight from the ground. An alternative hypothesis proposes that powered flight first required the capacity to take up the flight from the ground. Our hypothesis fits better with the second point of view and is not in conflict with the fact that several fossil non-Neornithes avian lineages would have been arboreal or gliders because animals without an adequate aerobic physiological capacity could have taken the advantage of climbing trees or reaching other elevated points in order to glide but not to perform a SFF. In this situation the control of gliding and landing could explain the early evolution of complex wings and feathers, including the presence of the alula<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par31">With the evidence that the cardiac morphology and physiology of tinamous is not suited for sustained flight we propose a new hypothesis on the acquisition of flight in Neornithes. The hypothesis, which we call the &#x0201c;heart to fly&#x0201d; hypothesis states that sustained flapping flight requires a large heart for the aerobic performance of the to the flight muscles. In consequence, the NSFF of tinamous is ancestral and represents the intermediate flight strategy between the non-Neornithes avian fossils and the modern neognathes. In this scenario, the typical jumping take-off from the ground followed by the NSFF that tinamous perform today is a reflex of the putative first type of flight performed by Neornithes, point of view that is in agreement with the neontological-based proposals of the evolution of the avian flight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Notice that although phasianids display a similar flight mode this is not reflected in an exhaustion of aerobic reserves and, from our definition, it is classified as SFF and not as NSFF.</p><p id="Par32">Based on the new hypothesis we envision the evolutionary history of modern birds as two different paths from an ancestor with a small heart and NSFF, much like the extant tinamous. The first path is the one exemplified by Ratites, in which the loss of the flight capacity (including the loss of all the pectoral musculature and their skeletal support) was aimed at optimizing cursorial abilities for better foraging and predator evasion. The second path is the one followed by Neognaths in which SFF was possible because of the larger heart and the suitable musculoskeletal organization were already in place. Only at this point, the adequate increase in stroke volume and cardiac output allowed for the real conquest of the air for modern Neognaths, and from here the evolution of other types of flight as gliding, soaring, hovering and even returning to short flapping flights and flightlessness.</p><p id="Par33">Two potential conflicts with the &#x0201c;heart to fly&#x0201d; hypothesis require further discussion, namely the larger heart mass of Ratites and the assumed flight capabilities of Lithornitids, an extinct paleognath clade.</p><p id="Par34">First, the heart in the few Ratites species studied to date, i.e. Ostrich, Emu and Greater Rhea is not small and fall in the range of most Neognath families (Suppl.

Because Ratites do not fly our &#x0201c;heart to fly&#x0201d; hypothesis implicitly requires that cardiac enlargement in birds occurred independently more than once. For ratites the selective pressure could have been the need for running endurance. Ostriches, for example, are acknowledged as the fastest bipeds with the largest capacity for long-endurance running<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.

Based on their nocturnal lifestyle and sedentarity, it is tempting to speculate that kiwis may have retained an ancestral small heart but data is missing.</p><p id="Par35">Although all modern phylogenies support the early divergence of paleognaths in the evolution of Neornithes, there are differences in the proposed phylogenetic relationships between ratites and tinamous.

This scenario is in line with our hypothesis of the plesiomorphy of tinamou traits and implies the secondary loss of flight in ratites. Molecular phylogenies, however, nest tinamous inside ratites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. At first sight, this could imply that tinamous acquired flight secondarily from flightless ancestors but we find it highly unlikely. Our suggestion, which is compatible with molecular phylogenies, is that the ancestral paleognath was capable of flight (a NSFF type) and lost it multiple times in different Ratite lineages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Living tinamous, descendants of some line of flying paleognaths, conserved NSFF and their ancestral cardiovascular traits.</p><p id="Par36">The second potential conflict relates to the flight capabilities of extinct paleognaths, which is inferred from the dispersed geographical location of fossil findings.

The lactate analyser has been previously validated for use with bird blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par55">Oxygen consumption was measured by open respirometry in a push-mode configuration before and immediately after the aerobic challenge test previously described. The animal was placed in a 6 liter air-tight chamber (18&#x02009;cm diameter&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;25&#x02009;cm height) equipped with two sets of tubing (Tygon R3603 3.2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4.8&#x02009;mm) leading air in and out with a controlled flow of 1200&#x02009;ml min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (FOX II Analyzer, Sable Systems International, Las Vegas, USA). To avoid dilution effects by the presence of water vapor, the air sample was dried through a desiccator column (30&#x02009;ml of indicating drierite, anhydrous calcium sulfate mixed with cobalt chloride, W. A. Hammond Drierite company Ltd, Xenia, USA). The FOX II Analyzer was connected to a laptop computer (Dell Latitude D600, Dell Inc., Round Rock, Texas, USA) via a serial connection and that data was stored using a custom made data acquisition program (Lab View 8.6, National Instruments, Austin, Texas, USA). Chamber flow (1200&#x02009;ml min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was set according to chamber volume and predicted VO<sub>2</sub> using published recommendations. Oxygen consumption was calculated using standard equations for the case when water vapor but not CO<sub>2</sub> is stripped from the gas sample as follows: V<sub>O2</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;Flow x ([O<sub>2</sub>]in-[O<sub>2</sub>]out) / (1-0.2 x [O<sub>2</sub>]out) where [O<sub>2</sub>]in and [O<sub>2</sub>]out are the concentrations of oxygen entering and exiting the chamber respectively.</p><p id="Par56">Body temperature was measured using a T-type thermocouple (RET-2, MLT1403, ADInstruments-Europe, Oxford, UK) inserted in the cloaca an average length of 55&#x02009;mm and the leading wire was fixed with tape to the root of a tail feather. The thermocouple was connected to a temperature pod (T-type Pod ML312, ADInstruments-Europe, Oxford, UK), a Powerlab amplifier (Model 4/35 ADInstruments-Europe, Oxford, UK) and finally the data was logged in a computer using LabChart 7Pro software (ADInstruments-Europe, Oxford, UK). To account for the effect of circadian rhythms all measurements were carried out between 10.00 and 15.00. A bird was taken from its cage without struggle in resting conditions and placed in 6-L plastic containers (18&#x02009;cm diameter&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;25&#x02009;cm height) for a period of 3&#x02009;h (pre-challenge baseline). After the aerobic challenge the animal was re-instrumented with the cloacal probe and immediately returned to the holding container for subsequent measurements (post-challenge, 2&#x02009;h). Measurements were carried out at two different ambient temperatures, at 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (range 23.2&#x02013;27&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) in an incubator (Yonar Incubadoras, Buenos Aires, Argentina) or 5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (range 3.8&#x02013;5.6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) in a refrigerator (FR093R, Daewoo Electronics Corp., Seoul, South Korea). Ambient temperatures in the enclosures at the time the measurements were made varied between 10&#x02013;15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Gene expression</title><p id="Par57">Myocardial tissue from the three species was obtained post-mortem and preserved in RNA<italic>later</italic>&#x000ae; Tissue Collection: RNA stabilization solution (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Walldorf, Germany) for 48&#x02009;h at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and later at &#x02212;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C prior to tissue processing.
