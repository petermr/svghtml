    "Membrane proteins represent a challenging family of macromolecules, particularly related to the methodology aimed at characterizing their three-dimensional structure. This is mostly due to their amphipathic nature as well as requirements of ligand bindings to stabilize or control their function. Recently, Mass Spectrometry (MS) has become an important tool to identify the overall stoichiometry of native-like membrane proteins complexed to ligand bindings as well as to provide insights into the transport mechanism across the membrane, with complementary information coming from X-ray crystallography. This perspective article emphasizes MS findings coupled with X-ray crystallography in several membrane protein lipid complexes, in particular transporters, ion channels and molecular machines, with an overview of techniques that allows a more thorough structural interpretation of the results, which can help us to unravel hidden mysteries on the membrane protein function."
