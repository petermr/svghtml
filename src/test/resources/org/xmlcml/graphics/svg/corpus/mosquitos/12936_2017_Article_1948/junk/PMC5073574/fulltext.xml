Recent evidence shows that leptin also plays a role in physiological courses other than eating behaviour; in fact, it can influence several developmental processes in the immature brain.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref></p><p>Leptin receptors are expressed throughout the brain, especially in the hippocampus and various cortical regions. Numerous evidence supports the role of leptin in higher cognitive functions, particularly the ability to boost physiological events underlying hippocampal-dependent learning and memory.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In the hippocampus, leptin facilitates the induction of synaptic plasticity by converting short-term potentiation of synaptic transmission into long-term potentiation (LTP), a process regarded as part of the neurophysiological basis of learning and memory formation.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Impairment of this process is associated with cognitive deficits.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In the prefrontal cortex, leptin is associated with increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and neurogenesis.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>If leptin in the physiological range may serve as a cognitive enhancer, elevated plasma leptin levels or hyperleptinaemia may act as a pathophysiological marker for impaired cognitive function due to tissue leptin resistance (LR). The cognitive effects of leptin depend on its ability to cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier (BBB) and the functionality of leptin receptors within the hippocampus and other brain regions.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The inability of peripheral leptin to reach the brain is called peripheral LR, while a diminished leptin receptor quantity and impaired signal transduction is known as central LR. In humans, both defects coexist. Also, hyperleptinaemia is a strong indicator of LR.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Ageing, disease such as diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders, and excessive exposure to saturated fats and refined sugars (eg, triglycerides and fructose) have been associated with dysfunctional leptin transport into the brain.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;15</xref> On the other hand, obesity has been initially associated with a period of central leptin hypersensitivity, followed by a phase of central LR.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Elevated plasma leptin levels have been associated with poorer cognitive outcomes in the middle-aged and elderly population as well as in certain diseases, including diabetes and Alzheimer's.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Although adolescence is an important period for shaping memory, very few studies have approached this topic in younger age groups, and they have mostly used animal models.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;20</xref> Aiming to translate knowledge from research to practice and policy, the objective of this study was to assess the association between leptin and cognition in youths in the &#x02018;real&#x02019; world by using functional cognitive measures such as school grades and grade point average (GPA).

The interactions were non-significant (data not shown), and therefore we did not stratify the analysis. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used in testing differences in serum leptin concentrations stratified by weight status (normal weight, overweight, obesity). Bonferroni's adjustments for multiple comparisons were used to examine the contrasts between groups. The same technique was used in testing differences in transformed school grades (9th to 12th) and GPA by leptin status (normal serum leptin and hyperleptinaemia). Adjustments were made for sex, weight status and IR status. To examine the association of leptin with school performance, we first conducted linear regression analysis. Serum leptin levels were tested against school grades (9th to 12th and GPA), using two models. Model 1 was adjusted for sex, fat mass and parental education. Model 2 added IR, nutritional quality of diet, PA status, type of secondary education (vocational and adult school), and iron supplementation in infancy (no added iron) to the covariates in model 1. A further analysis was conducted with logistic regressions to estimate the odds of performing &#x02265;50th and &#x02265;75th centile in our sample (outcome) in participants with hyperleptinaemia. For each outcome, three logistic models were estimated. The first one included health-related variables as covariates: weight status, IR, dietary and PA habits as independent variables. A second model added sex, parental education and type of secondary education in which participants completed HS.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study addressing the link between leptin status and this domain of cognition in a younger-age human population. Compared with students having normal serum leptin, those having hyperleptinaemia had lower school grades and GPA. Similarly, they had lowers odds of performing &#x02265;50th and &#x02265;75th centile of the sample. Even after controlling for relevant confounders, the association between leptin status in adolescence and AP remained significant.</p><p>Our results are of importance for several reasons. Leptin plays a key role in memory processing through induction of hippocampal and prefrontal cortex synaptic plasticity. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that elevated plasma leptin levels may limit the potential for synaptic plasticity and could partially explain some cognitive deficits.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;20</xref> Likewise, links are strong between memory performance and academic outcomes. In children, working memory and particularly the ability to retrieve and manipulate information from long-term memory has been found to predict math, reading and spelling outcomes, even after controlling for IQ.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Dysfunctions in this domain can lead to learning difficulties in activities that involve storing and processing information.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Furthermore, HS grades predict higher education outcomes and subsequent job status and income.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p><p>Very few studies have explored the link between leptin and cognition in younger animal populations, and their findings are in line with ours. Oomura <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> showed that leptin modulates higher neural functions in mice aged 4&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks. While infusion of low doses of leptin enhanced learning and memory performance and hippocampal LTP, high doses impaired them. The notion that hyperleptinaemia could be responsible for some cognitive deficits in adolescent mice is supported by Valladolid-Acebes <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref> In age-matched mice, short-term exposure to high-fat diet compromised hippocampal dependent learning and memory. Moreover, in adolescent mice, the behavioural impairment was accompanied by changes in hippocampal morphology and functionality of leptin receptors within the hippocampus.</p><p>Leptin levels in this Chilean sample were lower than those reported for European adolescents,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> but higher than those reported for healthy adolescents in other Latin America countries and Asia.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>
<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Population differences in the epidemiological and nutrition transition may in part explain the disparity in levels of circulating leptin. Increased intake of fat, sugar and processed foods, reduced PA, and increased risk of non-communicable disease, including obesity, are more prevalent in the last stages of the transition, which is the case of Chile and the European countries.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></p><p>Although an association between weight status and academic results was not observed in this sample, obesity in paediatric populations has been related to impaired cognitive function<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>
<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> and the ability to perform well in school.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>
<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Some authors have postulated that cognitive impairment may actually precede excessive weight gain.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49&#x02013;51</xref> Two main ideas are behind this view: first, impairment of learning is observed before other metabolic alterations; second, while the adverse effects of consuming high fat/high-sugar diet on cognitive function is a good predictor of subsequent weight gain, the effect of those nutrients on weight gain does not reliably predict subsequent cognitive deficit. Our results suggest that leptin might mediate, in part, the effect of weight status on cognition and academic outcomes.</p><p>It is very likely that hyperleptinaemia in most individuals in our sample may lead to both under-responsiveness to exogenous leptin and impairment of signal transduction in target neurons. Although obesity has been traditionally associated with hyperleptinaemia in the non-elderly population, new data indicate that fructose, sucrose and triglycerides may induce hyperleptinaemia regardless of the amount of body fat.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In our sample, less than half of the participants having hyperleptinaemia were obese, and 28% were of normal weight. Likewise, almost 80% had a diet in the intermediate or unhealthy zone, which means excessive intake of refined sugars and fats. Administration of even small quantities of triglycerides to normal weight rats immediately resulted in dysfunctional leptin transport across the BBB.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>
<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Similarly, rats exposed to high fructose diet demonstrated an impaired response to peripheral leptin injection and central leptin infusion. However, switching to a sugar-free diet improved leptin sensitivity.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> In both cases, chronic fructose and triglycerides consumption led to impaired responsiveness to exogenous leptin prior to body weight.</p><p>Our findings also confirm the role of nutrition in academic outcomes. Participants having an unhealthy diet had significantly lower odds of performing well in HS, independent of leptin status. Numerous studies report that diet relates to specific outcomes that are important for the educational attainment of children and adolescents.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;34</xref> The consumption of refined carbohydrates and saturated fats is linked to impaired cognitive performance. Exposure to these macronutrients interferes directly with hippocampal functioning by cutting down the production of neurotrophins, increasing neuroinflammatory markers, and altering the BBB.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>
<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> In addition, indirect adverse effects of diet on cognitive functioning, including reduced potential for synaptic plasticity and trafficking of neurotransmitter receptors in the hippocampus, have been related to diet-induced leptin and IR.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref>
<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>
<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></p><p>Last, in our sample, the share of participants with hyperleptinaemia was significantly higher in males compared with females. Notwithstanding that leptin is produced in the fat tissue, serum leptin concentration is also dependent on determinants such as insulin sensitivity and overconsumption of sucrose and fructose. Male and female participants in our study had similar prevalence of excess weight and IR, but the proportion of adolescents having a diet high in simple sugars, mostly sucrose and fructose from candies and sugar sweetened beverages (a dietary pattern regarded as a fair diet in our questionnaire), was significantly higher among males compared with females. Population surveys in the Chilean adolescent population confirm that adolescent males have excess consumption of simple carbohydrates.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>
<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></p><sec id="s4a"><title>Implications from these results</title><p>The Chilean adolescent population is highly exposed to risk factors for hyperleptinaemia. As reported by the 2014 Chilean National Food Consumption Survey,<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> dietary habits of poor nutritional quality are widespread. Adolescents aged 14&#x02013;18 rank first in the consumption of refined sugar (121&#x02005;g/day) and second in the consumption of saturated fats. According to this survey, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in adolescents is 38% and 13%, respectively.</p><p>A further implication from this study relates the fact that exposure to abnormally high levels of leptin would be starting early in life. A non-modifiable condition such as ageing is associated with hyperleptinaemia, but exposure to high fat/high-sugar diet as well as to overweight and obesity are avoidable. While schools should serve as a point of entry for the promotion of healthy lifestyles, the food industry uses schools as a means of reaching young consumers. Despite the efforts to limit the availability of unhealthy foods in schools, in the Latin-American Southern Cone 70% of adolescents drink sugar-sweetened beverages on a daily basis.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> Frequent (1&#x02013;2 times/week) and very frequent (&#x02265;3 times/week) fast-food consumption among Latin American adolescents ranges from 40% in Uruguay to 70% in Bolivia, according to a recent international study.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></p><p>The following points should be considered in the design and application of preventive strategies. Fructose-induced hyperleptinaemia may be reversible, which means that there is a possibility for improvement. Second, hyperleptinaemia may be triggered by exposure to even small amounts of saturated fats and refined sugars, which are major components of the Western diet. Moreover, the effects on leptin levels appear soon after exposure to these macronutrients. Finally, hyperleptinaemia is a precondition for LR; at this point, it might be late for adolescents to reach their full cognitive and academic potential.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Study limitations and strengths</title><p>Our results support the notion that leptin has an important role in cognitive function in addition to its role in energy balance regulation. A further strength is that we approached this topic in adolescents, whereas previous studies have been conducted in adults or the elderly. Third, we used functional measures of cognition (eg, AP in HS), aiming to examine this relation in the &#x02018;real&#x02019; world. In spite of these strengths, the study has limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings. First, our sample is not representative of the Chilean adolescent population, as it consists of adolescents from low-to-middle SES. However, SES level may be especially important. The prevalence of unhealthy dietary habits and obesity, both of which may lead to hyperleptinaemia, is higher among adolescents from low-to-middle SES compared with adolescents of high SES.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Second, we used cut-offs for hyperleptinaemia defined on the basis of statistical criteria in a European cohort, which are the only values described for healthy adolescents. It is worth noting that Chile, like Western European countries, is in the last stage of the epidemiological transition. Yet future studies should use cut-offs based on biological risk. Third, owing to data constraints, the prevalence of neuropsychiatric conditions was not included in the study. Leptin effects on memory and cognition might be confounded by the coexistence of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, schizophrenia and substance-related disorders. Fourth, we did not consider the mediating effect of potential learning and cognitive disorders which may impact student's academic functioning. Also, information on family structure is lacking in the analysis. Yet we considered the impact of parental education. Since association is not enough to prove causation, future studies should replicate and extend this analysis in other young populations, and further investigate how leptin influences cognitive and academic outcomes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to acknowledge the ongoing commitment of participants and their families.
