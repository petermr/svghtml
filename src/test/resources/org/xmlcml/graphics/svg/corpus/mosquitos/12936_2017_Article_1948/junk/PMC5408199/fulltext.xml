Meanwhile, C1P and LPA only exhibited a minor effect on the expression and secretion of these cytokines and chemokines. Moreover, neutralization of both enzymes with anti-rLlPLD1 antibodies completely inhibited the secretion of these cytokines and chemokines. Importantly, conditioned media from fibroblasts, treated with rLlPLDs, stimulated the transmigration of THP-1 monocytes.

Introduction</title><p>Envenomation from <italic>Loxosceles</italic> spider bites produces a clinical picture known as loxoscelism. This genus belongs to the <italic>Sicariidae</italic> family, and includes a large number of species described and extensively distributed worldwide [<xref rid="B1-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, the only species from genus <italic>Loxosceles</italic> routinely involved in human poisoning are <italic>Loxosceles laeta</italic>, <italic>Loxosceles intermedia</italic>, <italic>Loxosceles rufescens</italic>, <italic>Loxosceles gaucho</italic>, and <italic>Loxosceles reclusa</italic> [<xref rid="B2-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In Chile, it appears that <italic>L. laeta</italic> is the only relevant species [<xref rid="B2-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B5-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] that produces venom with strong biological activities [<xref rid="B6-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Loxoscelism occurs in two clearly defined clinical forms: cutaneous loxoscelism and viscero-cutaneous or systemic loxoscelism. Cutaneous loxoscelism is the most frequently occurring clinical form, and is characterized by severe skin alterations such as erythema, edema, and a marked inflammatory response, followed by the development of a dermonecrotic lesion with the typical presence of a livedoid plate. Conversely, systemic loxoscelism is a more severe but less common clinical picture characterized by intravascular hemolysis of erythrocytes, vascular alterations, and renal insufficiency, sometimes leading to patient death [<xref rid="B7-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. <italic>Loxosceles</italic> spider venom is mainly comprised of the phospholipase D (PLD) enzyme family [<xref rid="B4-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], which have been identified as the agent responsible for loxoscelism&#x02019;s tissue damage, involving alterations such as plaque aggregation [<xref rid="B9-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], dermonecrosis [<xref rid="B8-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], complement-dependent hemolysis of erythrocytes [<xref rid="B10-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], damage to blood vessels and fibrinogenolysis [<xref rid="B14-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and deregulation of neutrophil activation, which depends on endothelial cells [<xref rid="B15-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The <italic>Loxosceles</italic> PLDs can hydrolyze sphingomyelin to form ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P) and choline [<xref rid="B9-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It can also hydrolyze lysophospholipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine to form lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and choline [<xref rid="B16-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Regardless of the severity of the clinical form, one of the main features of <italic>Loxosceles</italic> venom poisoning is the strong inflammatory reaction in the bite site dermis. This is characterized by a massive infiltration of inflammatory cells, which can persist for weeks to months after the venom contact [<xref rid="B19-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, mice injected with <italic>L. gaucho</italic> venom exhibited increased macrophages and neutrophils as soon as 30 min post-injection and increasing until 24 h, accompanied by release of inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC) [<xref rid="B20-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the role of <italic>Loxosceles</italic> PLDs in the inflammatory response and in leukocyte recruitment is still controversial and not fully understood. In this regard, <italic>Loxosceles</italic> venom has no reported direct stimulatory effect on leukocytes [<xref rid="B21-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Instead, leukocyte activation involves blood vessel endothelial cells, which indirectly affect leukocytes when exposed to the venom. In this case, the venom acts as a potent endothelial cell agonist, inducing surface E-selectin expression and secretion of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8/CXCL8) [<xref rid="B15-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Then, the neutrophils migrate to the bite site and are subsequently activated and degranulate, resulting in inflammation and necrosis [<xref rid="B15-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additionally, dermis fibroblasts, together with the endothelia, have been suggested to be involved in the deregulated leukocyte activation, since up-regulated expression of IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CXCL2 has been reported in human foreskin fibroblast Hs68 cells exposed to recombinant <italic>L. reclusa</italic> PLD [<xref rid="B22-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, the product of sphingomyelin hydrolysis (C1P [<xref rid="B22-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]) or the product of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) hydrolysis (LPA [<xref rid="B23-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]) could reportedly be triggering the expression of these inflammatory mediators and neutrophil infiltration. Some recent results support this mechanism, including implications that LPA produced by LPC from <italic>L. similis</italic> venom or <italic>L. intermedia</italic> SMD could mediate the cytokine and chemokine release in fibroblasts, and that this effect is mediated by an LPA receptor [<xref rid="B24-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, the cytokines and chemokines produced by endothelial cells and fibroblasts in response to <italic>Loxosceles</italic> venom strongly suggest that these proteins play key roles in the leukocyte recruitment to the injury site and the development of inflammatory responses during poisoning. Most recent studies have focused on the chemotactic mediators induced by the <italic>Loxosceles</italic> venom on in vivo neutrophils recruitment. However, despite the importance of monocytes/macrophages in the inflammatory response, there are no studies demonstrating the link between cytokine and chemokine release in human skin fibroblasts in response to PLDs from <italic>Loxosceles</italic> venom and monocytes recruitment to the site of injury during cutaneous loxoscelism.</p><p>Previously, we expressed and purified two phospholipase D (PLD) isoforms of the spider <italic>Loxosceles laeta (rLIPLD1 and rLIPLD2)</italic>. The recombinant protein rLIPLD1 had hydrolytic activity on sphingomyelin and in vitro hemolytic activity on human red blood cells, whereas rLIPLD2 was inactive. This latter corresponds to a truncated isoform lacking one of the two essential histidine residues implicated in the catalytic action of the enzyme [<xref rid="B25-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We used these recombinant PLD proteins with different activity as a tool to evaluate the inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression and production profiles in human skin fibroblasts treated with recombinant PLDs of <italic>L. laeta</italic>, compared to C1P and LPA, and to determine their role in monocyte cells migration. Our data develop the expression and production profiles of cytokines and chemokines in human skin fibroblasts treated with recombinant PLDs of <italic>L. laeta</italic> (rLlPLDs) and the lipid inflammatory mediators C1P and LPA. The production of IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CCL2 was found to be a direct consequence of PLD&#x02019;s effect of <italic>L. laeta</italic> on fibroblast, while C1P and LPA only had minor effects on the secretion of these cytokines/chemokines. Finally, our data demonstrate that these chemotactic mediators promote monocyte migration.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-toxins-09-00125"><title>2.

Cytokines/Chemokines Profile in Human Skin Fibroblasts in Response to Recombinant PLD from <italic>L. laeta</italic> Venom</title><p>The human skin fibroblast HFF-1 cell line was used as a model for this study. These cells were treated with recombinant PLD isoforms from <italic>L. laeta</italic> (rLlPLD1 or rLlPLD2), which have been described previously [<xref rid="B25-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, cells were treated with the bioactive lipids C1P and LPA, which correspond, respectively, to the main products generated from the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin and lysophosphatidylcholine by <italic>Loxosceles</italic> PLDs [<xref rid="B11-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B18-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Each treatment was evaluated to determine its cytotoxicity in skin fibroblasts after 24 h. As expected, rLlPLD1 demonstrated cytotoxicity (death &#x0003e;50%) for fibroblasts at concentrations higher than 15 &#x003bc;g/mL (IC50 = 15.8 &#x003bc;g/mL). The remaining treatments (C1P, LPA, and rLlPLD2) exhibited no cytotoxicity (about 100% viability) on the cells at any of the evaluated concentrations.</p><p>Then, we screened for the synthesis and secretion profile of inflammatory cytokines produced in fibroblasts treated with recombinant PLDs (rLlPLD1 and rLlPLD2) at 5 &#x003bc;g/mL, and also with C1P (10 &#x003bc;M), LPA (10 &#x003bc;M), or LPS (10 &#x003bc;g/mL) using a 12 multi-analyte ELISArray panel. An inflammatory cytokines panel (IL1-&#x003b1;, IL1-&#x003b2;, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL12, IL17A, interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and GM-CSF), and a chemokines panel (IL8, MCP-1, RANTES, MIP-1&#x003b1;, MIP-1&#x003b2;, IP-10, I-TAC, MIG, Eotaxin, TARC, MDC, and GRO-&#x003b1;) were evaluated. The panel of 12 inflammatory cytokines showed IL-8 presence and at a lower level, IL-6 in the supernatants of fibroblasts treated with rLlPLDs as well as those treated with bioactive lipids C1P and LPA (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-toxins-09-00125">Supplementary Materials</xref>
<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-toxins-09-00125">Figure S1</xref>). Meanwhile, the remaining cytokines were not produced. Conversely, the 12-chemokine profiles indicated that IL-8, CCL2/MCP-1, and CXCL1/GRO-&#x003b1;, were only secreted in fibroblasts&#x02019; supernatant when they were treated with rLlPLD1 or rLlPLD2; meanwhile, C1P and LPA only induced secretion of CCL2 and CXCL1, but not IL-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-09-00125-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Fibroblasts treated with LPS did not secrete cytokines or chemokine.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-toxins-09-00125"><title>2.2. Recombinant PLD from <italic>L. laeta</italic> Induce Expression and Secretion of IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1/GRO-&#x003b1;, and CCL2/MCP-1 in Human Skin Fibroblasts</title><p>The mRNA expression pattern for genes IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1/GRO-&#x003b1;, and CCL2/MCP-1 were then evaluated. The study was performed in skin fibroblasts under basal conditions (Dulbecco&#x02019;s Modified Eagle&#x02019;s Medium (DMEM) only) as a control and with increasing concentrations of rLlPLD1 or rLlPLD2. Additionally, fibroblast cultures were incubated with different concentrations of C1P or LPA. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) performed on fibroblast cDNA obtained after 6 and 24 h of treatment indicated low constitutive expression levels of CCL2, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA. The recombinant proteins rLlPLD1 and rLlPLD2 showed a differential induction of IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CCL2 mRNA expression in fibroblasts at 6 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-09-00125-f002">Figure 2</xref>) and 24 h (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-toxins-09-00125">Figure S2</xref>). At 6 h of treatment, rLlPLD2 induced a marked expression of cytokines and chemokines compared to rLlPLD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-09-00125-f002">Figure 2</xref>). However, this effect reverted at 24 h of treatment, where the expression of IL-8, CXCL1, and CCL2 decayed markedly for rLlPLD2 and increased for treatment with rLlPLD1 (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-toxins-09-00125">Figure S2</xref>). The latter may indicate an early effect of rLlPLD2 on the induction of expression of these chemokines, and a late effect of rLlPLD1. On the other hand, IL-6 expression dropped dramatically at 24 h of treatment (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-toxins-09-00125">Figure S2</xref>), while C1P and LPA induced a markedly expression of CCL2 and a low expression of CXCL1, IL-6, and IL-8 at 6 h, which decayed at 24 h of treatment. C1P also induced a markedly expression of IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CCL2 at 6 h of treatment at a concentration of 10 &#x003bc;M, but not at higher concentrations.</p><p>IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CCL2 concentrations were evaluated by ELISA to determine if changes in mRNAs expression of these cytokines and chemokines were accompanied by an increase in their secretion in the supernatant of fibroblast culture. rLlPLD1 and rLlPLD2 were observed to induce markedly increased IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, and CXCL1 secretion in fibroblasts. However, the rLlPLD2 effect on cytokine and chemokine synthesis was significantly stronger than that of rLlPLD1. In fact, the IL-8 secretion induced by rLlPLD2 was 2.5 and 1.7 times greater at concentrations of 5 &#x003bc;g/mL and 10 &#x003bc;g/mL, respectively, than secretion induced by rLlPLD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-09-00125-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). In addition, under the same experimental conditions, IL-6 secretion induced by rLlPLD2 was 7.5 times higher than from rLlPLD1 when a concentration of 5 &#x003bc;g/mL was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-09-00125-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). The effect of rLlPLD2 for CXCL1 was 3.7 and 1.8 times greater than rLlPLD1 at concentrations of 5 &#x003bc;g/mL and 10 &#x003bc;g/mL, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-09-00125-f003">Figure 3</xref>c). However, CCL2 secretion was similar after treatment with both recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-09-00125-f003">Figure 3</xref>d). Additionally, the effects of C1P and LPA on IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CCL2 secretion in fibroblast culture supernatants were evaluated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-09-00125-f004">Figure 4</xref> shows that LPA affected IL-8 secretion at a rate of 2.7 times greater than C1P at concentrations of 30 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-09-00125-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). LPA, but not C1P, had an effect on the secretion of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-09-00125-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). Both C1P and LPA had a similar effect on CXCL1 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-09-00125-f004">Figure 4</xref>c). The effect of LPA on secretion of CCL2 was 3.3 and 3.8 times greater than C1P at concentrations of 10 &#x003bc;M and 30 &#x003bc;M, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-09-00125-f004">Figure 4</xref>d). The average concentrations of cytokines and chemokines induced by C1P or LPA in the supernatant of fibroblasts were lower than those induced by treatment with either recombinant PLD of <italic>L. laeta</italic> under all conditions tested.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-toxins-09-00125"><title>2.3. Cytokines/Chemokines Secreted by Fibroblasts Treated with PLDs from <italic>L. laeta</italic> Promote Monocyte Migration</title><p>Cell migration assays using THP-1 monocyte cultures were performed to evaluate the biological relevance of IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CCL2 secreted by human skin fibroblasts on leukocyte migration. THP-1 monocyte cultures were therefore incubated in different chemoattractant media, and their ability to migrate through a 5 &#x003bc;m pore size in a transmigration chamber was evaluated. First, the chemoattractant ability of C1P or LPA at different concentrations was evaluated for THP-1 monocytes. Both C1P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-09-00125-f005">Figure 5</xref>a) and LPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-09-00125-f005">Figure 5</xref>b) were found to be unable to stimulate by themselves the migration of THP-1 monocytes over the range of times and concentrations tested.</p><p>Subsequently the ability of the supernatant of fibroblasts treated with rLlPLD1 (Conditioned Medium 1; CM1) or rLlPLD2 (Conditioned Medium 2; CM2) to stimulate the migration of THP-1 monocytes was examined. Untreated medium (unconditioned medium; UCM) was used as no migration control, and recombinant human MCP-1 was used as a positive migration control. As a preliminary step, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CCL2 secretion in different conditioned media was confirmed by ELISA prior to performing migration assays. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-09-00125-f006">Figure 6</xref> shows that the conditioned media CM1 and CM2, contained each of the cytokines/chemokines, while the unconditioned medium did not. In addition, conditioned media were prepared with the recombinant proteins rLlPLD1 or rLlPLD2, neutralized by specific antibody against rLlPLD1 (rLlPLD1 + rabbit polyclonal anti-rLlPLD1, CM3; and rLlPLD2 + rabbit polyclonal anti rLlPLD1, CM4) to confirm that the secretion of these cytokines/chemokines in the culture supernatant of fibroblast HFF-1 cells was a consequence of the recombinant PLD action from <italic>L. laeta</italic>. The pre-incubation of recombinant proteins with polyclonal antibodies raised against rLlPLD1 completely inhibited IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CCL2 secretion by the fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-09-00125-f006">Figure 6</xref>), confirming that the expression and secretion of these cytokines/chemokines resulted from the effect of PLDs on the fibroblasts.</p><p>Finally, the incubation of THP-1 monocytes with the different conditioned media and subsequent assessment of migration capacity revealed that the conditioned media CM1 and CM2 could significantly induce the monocyte migration, unlike the results observed with UCM and with the conditioned media prepared with the neutralized recombinant proteins (CM3 and CM4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-09-00125-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, PLDs from the <italic>Loxosceles</italic> venom have been demonstrated to promote the production of inflammatory mediators in human skin fibroblasts, and it has been shown that these cytokines/chemokines can act as an important chemoattractant for inflammatory cells such as monocytes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-toxins-09-00125"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>Loxoscelism is considered to be a public health problem in several South American countries. However, the cutaneous form of loxoscelism (CL) has been the most frequently reported (81%&#x02013;84%) in Chile, with a lower incidence of systemic loxoscelism compared to CL (16%&#x02013;19%) [<xref rid="B5-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Loxoscelism in both its cutaneous and systemic clinical forms has a higher prevalence in Chile, Peru, and the Santa Catarina state of Brazil than in the rest of South America [<xref rid="B2-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B26-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and this is probably related with the endemic presence of the species <italic>L. laeta</italic>. Cutaneous loxoscelism is characterized by local signs and symptoms at the spider venom inoculation site, which involves erythema, edema, dermonecrosis, and a marked infiltration of inflammatory cells in the dermis and production of inflammatory mediators, followed by tissue necrosis [<xref rid="B4-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These events have been documented in experimental studies, in which an increase of neutrophils is observed in the first 6 h after inoculation with <italic>L. reclusa</italic> venom [<xref rid="B27-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Similarly, rabbits inoculated with <italic>L. intermedia</italic> venom displayed neutrophil accumulation in and around the blood vessels, with intense diapedesis as soon as 4 h after venom inoculation, along with a progressive accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, continuing until 5 days after animal envenomation [<xref rid="B29-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In mice inoculated with <italic>L. gaucho</italic> venom, neutrophils and mononuclear cells (monocytes and lymphocytes) were the predominant inflammatory cells recruited at 24 h post-injection. Mice were also found to release inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, MCP-1, and KC (homologue to CXCL1 in humans) into serum [<xref rid="B20-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The leukocyte incrementation and accumulation at the bite site correlate with clinical findings in patients with loxoscelism. These studies demonstrated an important leukocytosis and neutrophilia presence, increasing in patients until two weeks after poisoning [<xref rid="B30-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition, some patients displayed marked leukocytosis and IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; production in plasma [<xref rid="B31-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Monocytes are mononuclear phagocytes that can differentiate into macrophages and present antigens to drive an immune response. They have a key role as antigen-presenting cells, and in response to various stimuli, they extravasate from the bloodstream to peripheral sites, where they differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells, contributing to the host defense as well as tissue remodeling and repair [<xref rid="B32-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Considering the importance of monocytes in the inflammatory response, the present study evaluated the mechanism through which monocytes are recruited after <italic>L. laeta</italic> PLDs act upon human skin fibroblasts. Afterwards, the expression and secretion profiles for inflammatory cytokines and chemokines produced by fibroblasts in response to PLDs were evaluated. This study model was proposed because the main damage caused by <italic>Loxosceles</italic> venom is skin dermonecrosis, and cutaneous loxoscelism is the most frequent clinical presentation [<xref rid="B5-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The PLD family is known to make up the main components of <italic>Loxosceles</italic> venom, and are the agents responsible for its toxic effects [<xref rid="B4-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Different isoforms from the recombinant PLD family have been cloned and expressed, some of which have the dermonecrotic activity and others are inactive [<xref rid="B34-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We used two PLD isoforms from <italic>L. laeta</italic> in our study&#x02014; isoform 1 (rLlPLD1) and isoform 2 (rLlPLD2)&#x02014;as previously described [<xref rid="B25-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The latter corresponds to a catalytically-inactive isoform and does not have hemolytic activity on red blood cells. However, this isoform is highly immunogenic and confers immune-protection against dermonecrosis in rabbit models [<xref rid="B25-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Our work has demonstrated that both recombinant PLDs from <italic>L. laeta</italic> were able to induce cytokine IL-6 expression and secretion, in addition to the expression and secretion of chemokines IL-8, CXCL1, and CCL2 in human skin fibroblast HFF-1 cells. This may suggest that PLD activity is not a conditioning factor for inducing the expression and secretion of inflammatory mediators. Interestingly, the effect of rLlPLD2 on the production of theses cytokines/chemokines was stronger than rLlPLD1, and its effects on the expression of the tested cytokines and chemokines was early than showed by the catalytically active isoform rLlPLD1. Although rLlPLD2 corresponds to an inactive isoform, its major effect on the expression and secretion of cytokines and inflammatory chemokines could be as a consequence of differences in its structure and interaction with the substrate at the cellular level, triggering the activation of signaling pathways that finally activates the transcriptional factor nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-&#x003ba;B) in a more efficient way than rLlPLD1. However, this latter must be studied further, and the mechanism by which rLlPLDs could stimulate inflammatory mediator production remains to be described. In addition, the expression of many cytokines and chemokines is regulated by the transcriptional factor NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref rid="B35-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], so the latter may be hypothesized to have an important role in the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators activated in response to PLDs from <italic>Loxosceles.</italic> One interesting target could be the membrane microdomains enriched in sphingolipids (e.g., the lipid rafts), since they have an important content of sphingomyelin&#x02014;one of the main substrates for PLDs from <italic>L. laeta</italic>. Additionally, the participation of lipid rafts has been documented in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines induced by LPS and NF-&#x003ba;B activation [<xref rid="B36-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Despite the many unknowns, the effect of PLD of <italic>Loxosceles</italic> venom on the production of inflammatory mediators and activation of NF-&#x003ba;B has been documented in different cell types, such as endothelial cells and fibroblasts. In this latter cell type, it has been demonstrated that human foreskin fibroblast cell line Hs68 treated with recombinant SMD from <italic>L. reclusa</italic> not only over-expresses IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CXCL2, but also IL-1&#x003b2;, CCL5 (RANTES), and the transcriptional factor NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref rid="B22-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The results presented in this study were consistent with the above description. However, CXCL2 was not studied here, and both IL-1&#x003b2; and CCL5 were not detected in the ELISArray panel screening. In addition, Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) and A549 epithelial cells treated with <italic>L. deserta</italic> venom have demonstrated increased expression and accumulative secretion of IL-8, CXCL1/GRO-&#x003b1;, and CCL2/MCP-1, but not CCL5 [<xref rid="B19-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; and the expression induction mechanism was via a NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent pathway [<xref rid="B37-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The induction of IL-6, IL-8, and CXCL1 by recombinant PLDs from <italic>L. laeta</italic> on fibroblast HFF-1 cells corroborates the reported induction of cytokines and chemokines in response to the venom from other <italic>Loxosceles</italic> species. Importantly, our report showed the production of CCL2/MCP-1, which had not been documented to date in fibroblasts treated with recombinant PLD of <italic>L. laeta</italic> venom. In addition, the effect of recombinant PLD from <italic>L. laeta</italic> on the production of cytokines and chemokines was confirmed in the present study by demonstrating that fibroblast cultures treated with recombinant PLDs that were neutralized with specific antibodies completely abolished IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CCL2 production, suggesting a direct role of PLDs in the stimulation of inflammatory mediator expression and secretion.</p><p>Additionally, the expression and secretion profile of cytokines and chemokines induced by the products of the enzymatic degradation of sphingomyelin (i.e., C1P) and lysophosphatidylcholine (i.e., LPA) were evaluated. These are known to be produced by the action of PLD from <italic>Loxosceles</italic> venom [<xref rid="B9-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B11-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B17-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. C1P has been suggested to be the inducing agent in the expression of IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CXCL2 present in fibroblasts treated with recombinant <italic>L. reclusa</italic> PLD [<xref rid="B22-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This hypothesis was challenged by van Meeteren et al. [<xref rid="B23-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], who proposed that LPA rather than C1P was responsible for the induction of cytokines and chemokines expression by activating LPA receptor-mediated signaling pathways. To test this mechanism, Horta et al. [<xref rid="B24-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] demonstrated that LPA mediates the release of IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CXCL2, involving the participation of an LPA receptor in fibroblasts treated with either the venom of <italic>L. similis</italic> or recombinant PLD from <italic>L. intermedia</italic>. However, the direct extracellular effects of LPA were not demonstrated.</p><p>In our study, both C1P and LPA had only minor effects on the expression and secretion of the evaluated cytokines and chemokines when compared to the effects of recombinant PLD from <italic>L. laeta</italic>. Regardless, C1P and LPA have been documented as important inflammatory lipid mediators [<xref rid="B38-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, the role of C1P as an inflammatory mediator is contradictory. Thus, although C1P has been characterized as a pro-inflammatory molecule by cPLA2 activation and production of pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid metabolites [<xref rid="B40-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], an anti-inflammatory effect has been documented depending on cell type [<xref rid="B41-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thus, C1P can be considered as a negative regulator of the LPS-dependent secretion for TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref rid="B42-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and additionally, exogenous C1P reduces the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines mediated by LPS in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in HEK 293 cells expressing the TLR4 receptor through a reduction in NF-&#x003ba;B activation [<xref rid="B43-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Meanwhile, LPA has the capacity to evoke and modulate immune responses by directly attracting and activating T-cells, B-cells, and macrophages, and influencing their interactions with other cell types [<xref rid="B44-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. An anti-inflammatory effect of LPA has been observed in mouse peritoneal macrophages with the activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, as well as the serine/threonine phosphatases and PI3 kinase pathways, where LPA significantly inhibited the LPS-dependent secretion of TNF-&#x003b1; in a dose between 1 and 10 &#x003bc;M [<xref rid="B45-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. LPA is present in all mammalian cells and tissues, including blood, with plasma concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 &#x003bc;M, and serum concentrations that can exceed 10 &#x003bc;M [<xref rid="B39-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Meanwhile, levels of C<sub>18</sub>-C1P in human serum have been reported at concentrations of 0.126 for males and 0.170 &#x003bc;M for females [<xref rid="B46-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, the LPA or C1P concentrations produced by <italic>Loxosceles</italic> PLD action under pathophysiological conditions such as cutaneous loxoscelism are unknown. Therefore, differences in the expression and secretion of cytokines and chemokines evaluated in this report cannot be ruled out as merely being a consequence of the experimental concentrations used (&#x0003e;10 &#x003bc;M), and higher concentrations of C1P and LPA could inhibit the expression and secretion of cytokines and chemokines, depending on the activation of the transcriptional factor NF-&#x003ba;B, which is well known as a regulator of the expression of IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CCL2, as well as several other cytokines and chemokines [<xref rid="B35-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This latter can be reaffirmed in our study, as a concentration of 10 &#x003bc;M induced a strong expression of the cytokines and chemokines studied in fibroblasts at 6 h of treatment, unlike what was observed with higher concentrations.</p><p>The C1P or LPA chemoattractant effect on THP-1 monocyte migration was also evaluated. In both cases, no increase in migration was observed when compared with the control. Exogenously-added C1P has been documented to be capable of inducing the cellular migration of RAW 264.7 macrophages through the participation of a C1P receptor coupled to a Gi protein [<xref rid="B47-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This effect depends on the activation of the MEK/ERK 1-2 and PI3-K/PKB (Akt) signaling pathways and the final activation of the transcriptional factor NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref rid="B48-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Similarly, C1P effects have been observed for THP-1 monocytes and pre-adipocytes 3T3 migration, only when cells were stimulated for 24 h with exogenous C1P [<xref rid="B48-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Additionally, LPA has been demonstrated to induce cell migration of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) by activating the PI3-K/PKB (Akt) signaling pathway [<xref rid="B49-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The discrepancies shown in our report could be due to C1P and LPA being bound to cellular receptors for efficiently inducing cell migration [<xref rid="B48-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]; meanwhile, in our migration assay, the chemoattractant and cells were separated by a membrane, and cells were not stimulated before migration assay, indicating that C1P or LPA do not have a chemoattractant effect by themselves, emphasizing the importance of the interaction between C1P and its receptor. Additionally, the C1P receptor is reportedly a low affinity receptor, requiring high C1P concentrations [<xref rid="B47-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Furthermore, high bioactive lipid concentrations could have inhibitory or adverse effects on processes such as cell proliferation; for example, LPA is reportedly able to stimulate cell proliferation of THP-1 monocytes at concentrations of 1 &#x003bc;M, but not at higher concentrations (10 and 20 &#x003bc;M), despite the induction of the expression of LPA receptors at the cellular level [<xref rid="B50-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>Finally, this study demonstrated that human skin fibroblast HFF-1 cells treated with the recombinant proteins rLlPLD1 or rLlPLD2 (conditioned medium) stimulate the migration of THP-1 monocytes. Monocytes play a pivotal role in innate immunity, since they leave the bloodstream and migrate to tissues where they differentiate into macrophage or dendritic cell populations. This recruitment is essential for effectively controlling and clearing pathogenic microorganism infections, but also contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory and degenerative diseases [<xref rid="B51-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This chemotactic effect was mainly mediated by the presence of IL-8, CCL2/MCP-1, and CXCL1/GRO-&#x003b1; in the conditioned media; this was corroborated with fibroblast cultures treated with neutralized recombinant proteins, where the secretion of these chemoattractant mediators was completely abolished. The role of these inflammatory mediators in cell migration is well known, since these chemokines are involved in the chemotaxis of different immune cells. IL-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) are the most important chemokines for the recruitment of PMN cells and monocytes, respectively. In particular, CCL2 (MCP-1)&#x02014;a member of the CC chemokines family&#x02014;is a potent chemotactic factor for monocytes, T-lymphocytes, basophils, and natural killer (NK) lymphocytes [<xref rid="B52-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In bacteria such as <italic>Chlamydophila pneumoniae</italic>, PLDs acting as a TLR4 agonist induce the expression and production of different chemokines (e.g., CCL2 in endothelial cells), and promote the migration of Th-17 cells and a Th-17-mediated immune response [<xref rid="B53-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. So, the role of the different T lymphocyte subpopulations requires further study. In addition, an evaluation of the chemotactic role of the cytokines not tested by the ELISArray panel (e.g., IL-15) during the loxoscelism inflammatory process appears to be required, since IL-15 treated monocytes have been reported to stimulate the production of chemokines such as IL-8 and CCL2/MCP-1, which favor the accumulation of inflammatory cells [<xref rid="B54-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. IL-8 (CXCL8) is considered one of the most potent neutrophil chemoattractants in inflammation, and also for basophils, T-lymphocytes, and endothelial cells [<xref rid="B55-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and CXCL1 (GRO-&#x003b1;) is a chemoattractant of neutrophils and endothelial cells [<xref rid="B56-toxins-09-00125" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Thus, based on our results, CCL2 can be considered as the main chemotactic mediator for monocytes, and IL-8 together with CXCL1 can be considered as the main chemotactic mediator for neutrophils in response to the PLDs of <italic>Loxosceles.</italic></p><p>Our data strongly suggest that PLDs from <italic>L. laeta</italic> venom are the main inductors of the expression and secretion of inflammatory mediators in human skin fibroblasts during cutaneous loxoscelism, and suggest that as consequence, fibroblasts secrete inflammatory mediators which are responsible for the recruitment of monocytes to the site of damage.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-toxins-09-00125"><title>4.
