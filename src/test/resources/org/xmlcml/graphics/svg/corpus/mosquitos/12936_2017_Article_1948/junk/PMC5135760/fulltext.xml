As a result, several school programmes have been implemented, however the effectiveness of these needs to be evaluated to identify and prioritize strategies to curve this trend.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Cluster randomized controlled trial. Twelve primary public schools chosen at random over three regions of the country will take part in this study. The sample size consisted of a total of 1,655 children. For each region one school will be selected for each of the three nutritional intervention modes and one school will be selected as the control group. The intervention modes consist of the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Healthy Kiosk and nutritional education (KSEAN);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Optimized physical activity (AFSO);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Healthy Kiosk and nutritional education (KSEAN)&#x02009;+&#x02009;optimized physical activity (AFSO);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Control group.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The effectiveness of each intervention will be evaluated by determining the nutritional condition of each child by measuring percentage of body fat, BMI and the z-score of the BMI. This study will also identify the eating behaviours, nutritional knowledge and fitness of each child, along with the effective time of moderate activity during physical education classes.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>A protocol to evaluate the effectiveness of a school based intervention to control and/or reduce the rates of childhood obesity for children between 6 and 10 years of age was developed. The protocol was developed in line with the Declaration of Helsinski, the N&#x000fc;remberg Code and the University of Chile Guidelines for ethical committees, and was approved by the INTA, Universidad de Chile ethical committee on Wednesday 12 March 2014.</p><p>There is consensus among researchers and health and education personnel that schools are a favourable environment for actions to prevent and/or control childhood obesity. However a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of interventions to date has led some to question the wisdom of allocating resources to programmes. This is the first study of this kind in Chile and could be an important first step to provide guidance to political authorities in relation to which food and nutrition strategies to prioritize to curve this alarming trend.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>

During this process, very rapid changes have taken place, going from a pre-transition condition where infectious maternal and child diseases predominated public health issues during the decade of the 60s, to a post-transitional condition where chronic, non-infectious diseases dominate (ENT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Studies have identified that this has resulted due to a broader dietary offering, changes in eating patterns and a considerable increase in sedentary behaviours/lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The Junta de Auxilio Escolar y Becas (JUNAEB), a Chilean government organization, measures the height and weight of all 6-year-old children attending year one of primary school and found that during 2013 the obesity prevalence for this group of children was 25.3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated that there is convincing evidence that a sedentary lifestyle along with a diet consisting of a high consumption of foods high in calories and deficient in fruits, vegetables, legumes and fat-free dairy products increases the risk of obesity. However, a suitable home and school environment that promotes the choice and consumption of healthy foods could reduce this risk in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Childhood obesity is one of the main issues affecting public health, not only due to its increased incidence, but also because the obesity is maintained throughout adolescence and adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], some types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], discrimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and weight-related problems, as well as other illnesses, where the short- and long-term risks of childhood obesity translate to a decrease in quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], requiring earlier interventions that result in healthy behaviours within an obesogenic environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Schools have been identified as a key setting in the reduction or prevention of the prevalence of overweight and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], as they provide continuous and intensive contact with children during their formative years. The school infrastructure and the physical environment, policies, programmes and staff have great potential to provide a positive influence on the health of children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, most research has been based on diverse strategies, covering one or more components (nutritional education, reducing time spent in front of the television, providing reading material, modifying the school menu, reducing sedentary behaviours) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and has not been able to show convincing results regarding the effectiveness of school-based programmes in reducing overweight and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Even though school-based interventions have been clearly shown to be more effective than interventions in other settings, it has not been demonstrated that interventions consisting of multiple elements are more advantageous than ones consisting of a single element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This has resulted in the growing need to generate high-quality evidence to guide public policymaking in this area.</p><p>Since the year 2000, a series of structural and individual initiatives, linked with the promotion of healthy lifestyles to prevent obesity in the population, have been promoted in Chile. These initiatives have implemented programmes to promote healthy lifestyles in schools, such as VIDA CHILE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and the Global Strategy against Obesity (EGO-CHILE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Additionally, in 2012, the National Education Council approved changes to the school curriculum that increased the number of hours dedicated to physical activity in schools to 3 or 4 hours per week, and promulgated a new law, the &#x0201c;Ley de Composici&#x000f3;n Nutricional de los Alimentos y su Publicidad&#x0201d;, which prohibits the marketing/advertising and the sale inside schools of foods high in calories, saturated fats, sugars and sodium to children under the age of 14 years&#x0feff; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>The KIND study looks at addressing the deficiencies of previous studies and as such should enable evaluation of the effectiveness of an integral school-based intervention in diet and physical activity. The study is aimed at controlling the increase in obesity in children aged between 6 and 10 years, from a medium-low and low socio-economic status, that attend public schools. This study will be conducted in three regions of the country and will provide valuable information that should enable the development of an integral view of the dietary and nutritional status of children attending public schools in Chile.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>The proposed study is a cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a school-based intervention in nutritional education and physical activity over two school years in children aged between 6 and 10 years, attending primary public schools.

Afterwards, each school is to invite the parents of the potential participants to meet with the research team, who will explain in detail the aim of the research study. The parents will also be provided with an information sheet detailing the nature and importance of this study and indicating explicitly that it is necessary to have the parents&#x02019;/guardians&#x02019; consent before a child can participate in this study.</p><p>A phone number will also be provided to the parents to use in case of any doubts or concerns related to this study.

All parents that indicate that they do not want to participate will be thanked for their time and cooperation.</p><p>Children older than 8&#x000a0;years of age that are motivated to participate will be invited to sign an agreement, which will later be used to inform the parents and invite them to participate by signing the consent form. Both the agreement and the consent form have been previously approved by the ethics committee of the Nutrition and Food Technology Institute (INTA) from the Universidad de Chile.</p><p>Once the consent forms have been signed, a third meeting is to be organized, where the activities related to this study to be conducted during the school year will be described in detail.</p><p>Parents will be informed that this study will determine the nutritional status of each child by measuring weight, height, skinfolds and waistline. These measurements only require that the children remove their shoes and any other heavy element that they might be carrying. It will also be indicated that they will need to answer a survey aimed at determining their current dietary behaviours and that the children&#x02019;s fitness levels, along with the intensity of the activities conducted in the physical education classes, will be determined by conducting the following tests:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Grip strength: consists of squeezing a dynamometer with both right and left hands.

</p><p>It will be indicated to the parents that all of these tests will be conducted under the supervision of a qualified physical education teacher with experience in conducting all of the tests along with a teacher from the school. It will also be explained that all of the tests should take approximately 15&#x000a0;min to complete and that these will be conducted at the beginning and end of the school year during class time. The only measurement that will be taken throughout the whole year is the intensity of the physical education class. The child&#x02019;s nutritional status will be informed by means of a letter addressed to the parents.</p><p>It will also be indicated that the participation in this study is voluntary and that a child can choose to stop participating at any moment. Additionally, it will be made clear that the participation in this study will not incur any cost for the families of the children nor the school, and that all of the information collected will be kept confidential and will only be used for this study.</p><p>The diagram shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> below, shows the flow of the suggested recruitment process for this study:<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Participant recruitment process</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2016_3878_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

Teachers will provide knowledge and skills in relation to choosing healthy foods at school and at home by providing learning material. Year one to year four students participating in the programme will work with learning material based on the dietary guidelines for the Chilean population that provides nutritional concepts that are reinforced with theory and practical activity, along with the creation of healthy messages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. To enhance the effectiveness, the nutritional education activities will be scheduled over 16 sessions of 90&#x000a0;min each. As this is not part of the curriculum, the teacher in charge of each teaching unit (UTP), at each individual school, will define the time when this content will be presented to the students.
