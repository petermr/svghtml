  <span class="columnSpan">In sub-Saharan Africa, malaria vector control relies predominantly on insecticide-based, methods, namely long-lasting insecticide treated bed nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) of households. In Tanzania, LLINs are widely distributed and used as the primary and most affordable protective measure against 1–3 diseases vectors. The country has also recently implemented IRS, as a complementary vector control intervention in the northwestern regions, with 11.6% –4,5 ered by IRS. Globally, implementation of LLINs and IRS, coupled with improved case diagnosis and treatment, as well as urbanization, improved living standards, and overall improvements in health systems, have contributed to 37% and 60% reduction of malaria morbidity and mortality respectively, between 6 2000 and 2015. In Tanzania, high malaria transmission remains, with an average prevalence of 14.8% in children under 5 years Nevertheless, the National Malaria Control Program currently has a strategic goal of reducing malaria prevalence to 1% by 2020 Despite the recent successes, efficacy of current malaria interventions is hampered by numerous challenges, particularly 9–11 insecticide resistance in malaria vectors. This has necessitated continuous insecticide resistance monitoring and periodic 12–15 changes of insecticides used. Some countries have put in place mechanisms to monitor susceptibility of malaria vectors to insecticides using guidelines provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Plan for Insecticide Resistance 16 Monitoring (GPIRM). However, due to limited resources, insecticide resistance monitoring is mainly carried out only at large scale, often focusing on differences between districts or 9,14 regions. In Tanzania, insecticide susceptibility monitoring in mosquito populations is conducted at district level, relying on designated sentinel sites in regions, considered to be representative 14,15 of the whole country. Such a generalized approach to insecticide resistance monitoring is not very effective to capture local variations, where there might be pockets of high and low malaria 17,18 transmission areas. The variations may be due to, among other factors, impacts of interventions or genetic differences in mosquito populations, in turn resulting in physiological differences 17,18 in response to insecticidal pressures. Different mosquito populations respond differently to insecticide pressure, depending on presence or absence, and type of resistance 19–21 genes prevalent in the population. This results in occurrence of geographically distinct populations, which might result in transmission variability over space and time. It is likely that these fine scale-variabilities are associated with the occurrence of residual mosquito biting “hotspots”, contributing to persistent residual malaria transmission in areas where LLINs and IRS are already 18 widely used. Despite this, most vector surveillance programs still use global approaches without taking population variability into consideration. Furthermore, insecticide resistance studies have mainly focused on adult female mosquitoes, with limited studies on male populations. Introduction</span>

  <span class="columnSpan">Wellcome Open Research 2017, 2:96 Last updated: 22 JAN 2018nearby villages in south-eastern Tanzania, where insecticides have been widely used for public health and agriculture, but where malaria transmission still persists.Study villagesSampling of mosquito larvae was carried out in three proximal villages of Minepa (-8.2665°°SS, 36.6775°°EE), Lupiro (- 8.3857°°36.6791°°EE), and Mavimba (- 8.3163°°SS, 36.6810°°EE), located in Ulanga district, south-eastern Tanzania (Figure 1). The minimum distance between villages was ~4km from Minepa to Mavimba, while the maximum distance was 9km from Minepa to Lupiro. All the villages lie between 120 and 350 meters above sea level, and are located in the flood plains of the Kilombero river, between the Udzungwa mountain ranges to the north, and Mahenge hills to the 71–3. south. The main economic activity of the area is irrigated rice farming. The irrigation leaves rice paddies continuously flooded, 8 .creating permanent water bodies favourable for mosquito breed-ing habitats. It is also a perennially meso-endemic malaria area, where transmission is predominantly by An. funestus s.s and 22–25An. arabiensis. Recent multiple assessments conducted in the same area have revealed that 100% of the An. gambiae s.l25,26toes in this study area were An. arabiensis. As such, all field-collected An. gambiae s.lreferred to as An. arabiensis.1–3vention in the area is LLINs.Mosquito sampling and rearingLarval collections were carried out in the dry season between June and December 2015, and in the wet season between January and May 2016. For each village, between seven and nine breeding sites were identified, geo-referenced, and permanently established as larval sampling points for resistance monitoring during this study. Immediately after sampling, larvae were separated into anophelines and culicines to prevent cannibalism, and for easier adult mor-phological identifications. After morphological identification, lar-vae were pooled by village and reared into adults under standard insectary conditions (temperature of 27 ±±°°CC and relative humidity 2770–90%) in a semi-field screen house. During rearing, larvae were fed on mud, and algae collected from the respective breeding sites, ®®and supplemented with Tetraminmany). Each morning, pupae were transferred into a plastic cup and placed in a net-covered cage for adult emergence. After emergence, adults were separated by sex, transferred into individual small cages with provision of 10% glucose solution and maintained at 27–28°°and relative humidity of 70–90% for subsequent bioassays.Insecticide susceptibility testsPhenotypic resistance tests on adults were conducted follow-28ing WHO guidelines. Prior to susceptibility tests, efficacy of insecticide impregnated papers was verified against a known laboratory-reared susceptible An. gambiae s.s.29,30strain). A group of 20 –male mosquitoes aged three to five days were exposed for an hour to the diagnostic concentrations of 0.05% lambda-cyhalothrin, Methods</span>

During the one hour exposure to insecticides, knockdown rates were recorded at 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 minute intervals. After the exposure period, mosquitoes were transferred to holding tubes and maintained on 10% glucose solution. The final mortalities were recorded 24 hours post- exposure. Dead and surviving mosquitoes were kept separately, under preservation using silica in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, for further molecular examination of resistance genes. Synergist bioassays using piperonyl butoxide (PBO), an inhibitor of monooxygenase, and triphenyl phosphate (TPP), an inhibitor of esterases, were performed on the adult mosquitoes, to assess whether the pyrethroid resistance phenotypes observed during WHO susceptibility assays could be reversed by synergistic activity of these insecticides, which would indicate a biochemical 28,31 basis for the resistance. Prior to the synergist assays, the bio-efficacy and quality of PBO and TPP synergist papers was validated against a reference laboratory colony, whose pyrethroid resistance and DDT resistance is mediated by high monooxyge-32 nases (FUMOZ-R) respectively. Due to limited number of mosquito sample, the PBO and TPP assays were performed only on female An. arabiensis from Minepa village, and PBO test only in female An. arabiensis sampled from Mavimba village between the months of September and December 2016. Non-blood fed, 2–3 day old wild female An. arabiensis of 20 to 25 mosquitoes per tube with two controls. Five replicates were performed for each exposure set. Mosquitoes were pre-exposed to (either 4% PBO or 20% TPP) for 60 minutes, followed by exposure to WHO test papers impregnated with discriminatory doses of candidate insecticides (0.75% permethrin, 0.05% deltamethrin, 0.05% lambda-cyhalothrin, or 4% DDT) for another 60 minutes. To assess the effect of insecticides alone, another group of mosquitoes without pre-exposure to the synergists were concurrently exposed to each candidate insecticide only. At the same time, the same number of mosquitoes was exposed to either 4% PBO or 20% TPP only. Another group of mosquitoes was also exposed to control filter papers treated with a mixture of olive oil and acetone, and to plain filter papers with no chemicals that were used as environmental controls. During the one hour exposure to synergist and to insecticides, the knock- down rates were recorded at 5,10,15,20,25,30,40,50 and 60 minute intervals. Mosquitoes were fed on 10% glucose solution, and mortalities from assays conducted with and without exposure 31 to synergist were scored 24 hours post-exposure. A hydrolysis probe assay was used to screen for L1014F ( and L1014S (kdr-e) mutations in 220 randomly selected dead and alive female specimens, which had shown resistance to both DDT or pyrethroids, using procedures previously described Synergist bioassays Knockdown resistance (kdr) detection using hydrolysis probe analysis</span>

The observed mortality in control groups was consistently below 5%, so no statistical correction was required. The WHO susceptibility test findings are summarized in Figure 1 Table 1. There was marked seasonal and spatial variations in phenotypic resistance in both female and male An. arabiensis three pyrethroids, permethrin, deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, but also to bendiocarb and DDT in the study villages. For example, in Minepa village, the female mosquitoes were fully susceptible to bendiocarb in the wet season (mean mortality of 100%), yet highly resistant in the dry season (24.6%). Bendiocarb resistance also varied across different locations. While females collected from Minepa village in the dry season were resistant to bendiocarb, samples of the same species collected from the nearby villages of Mavimba and Lupiro during the same season were fully susceptible to the same chemical (100%). It was also observed that female An. arabiensis village were fully susceptible to DDT (100%) in both seasons, while those collected from the nearby Mavimba village during dry season showed reduced susceptibility to DDT (96.5%), and resistance to the same insecticide in Lupiro village in the wet season (83.5%). Wild female mosquito populations from Minepa, Mavimba and Lupiro villages displayed variable levels of deltamethrin resistance across both seasons, but reduced susceptibility to this insecticide (90.3%) in dry season in Lupiro. Throughout the study, female An. arabiensis (mortality rates between 21.6% and 87.4%) in both seasons across the study villages. As shown in Table 1, insecticide resistance variation in the male An. arabiensis observed for pyrethroids, DDT and bendiocarb. Males collected from Minepa were fully susceptible to permethrin in the dry season (100% mortality), but resistant to the same chemical in the wet season (80.5% mortality); those collected from Mavimba village on the other hand were susceptible to permethrin in the wet season (97.5%), but resistant in dry season (77.4%). In Lupiro village, the males were fully susceptible to permethrin in wet seasons (98.8%), though there were also signs of weakening susceptibility among mosquitoes collected in dry season (97.2%). Deltamethrin resistance in male An. arabiensis (87.5%) and in dry season in Mavimba (60.8%). There was also reduced susceptibility to deltamethrin in the male mosquito population sampled from Mavimba (91.3%) and Lupiro (90.6%) in wet season, but complete susceptibility was observed in Minepa (98.5%) and Lupiro in dry season (100%).

A minor exception was specimens collected in wet season from Lupiro, where reduced susceptibility was observed against DDT (95.3%). As illustrated in Figure 1, both male and female mosquito populations across the study villages and during both seasons remained fully susceptible to propoxur, dieldrin and all organophosphates tested (mortality rates between 98.8% and 100%). Tests with PBO.There was a reduction in time to 50% knockdown (KDT) in mosquito cohorts pre-exposed to PBO followed by 50 deltamethrin, permethrin, lambda cyhalothrin and bendiocarb), compared to cohorts directly exposed to each of the candidate insecticides without PBO pre-exposure (Table 2). Resistance reduction levels of 1.4, 3.1, 1.9 and 1.5 fold were recorded in tests of deltamethrin, permethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin and bendiocarb, respectively. The resistance reduction ratios for all tested insecticides are shown in Table 2. There was also a significant difference in 24-hr post-exposure mortality between mosquito cohorts (Table 3). Our tests revealed significant increases in mortalities when the mosquito populations were pre-exposed to PBO followed by deltamethrin compared to when the same populations were exposed to deltamethrin alone (paired t-test, df = 3, t = 18.4, and P &lt; 0.001). Pre-exposure to PBO followed by permethrin also resulted in a significant increase in mortality relative to exposure to permethrin alone (paired t-test, df = 3, t = 9.80, and P = 0.002). Similarly, pre-exposure to PBO followed by lambda cyhalothrin yield a significant increase in mortality compared to cohorts exposed to lambda cyhalothrin alone (paired t-test, df = 3, t = 10.3, and P = 0.002). In tests for bendiocarb resistance, it was observed that pre-exposure to PBO created substantial synergism, resulting in higher mortality compared to exposure to bendiocarb with no synergist (paired t-test, df =3, t = 22.46, and P &lt; 0.001). Tests with TPP.There was a slight decrease in KDT50 mosquitos were pre-exposed to TPP followed by either deltamethrin, permethrin or bendiocarb, compared to when the same population of mosquitoes was exposed to the candidate insecticides alone (Table 2). Resistance to deltamethrin, permethrin, and bendiocarb were reduced by 0.9, 1.4, and 1.3 fold, respectively, with TPP (Table 2). However, there was no difference in mortalities in mosquitoes exposed to deltamethrin with or without pre-exposure to TPP (paired t-test, df = 3, t = 0.73, and P = 0.520). Also, there was no statistical difference in mean mortalities of mosquitoes exposed to TPP plus permethrin compared to when they were exposed to permethrin alone (paired t-test, df = 3, t = 0.88, and P = 0.444). On the other hand, there were differences in the mean mortality between bendiocarb and TPP + bendiocarb (paired t-test, df = 3, Results of the synergist bioassays conducted with samples from Minepa village</span>

In Minepa, bendiocarb resistance was detected in the dry season, but completely diminished in wet seasons for both male and female populations, and DDT resistance followed a similar trend in the male population. However, in Lupiro village, DDT resistance was observed during the wet season only. The seasonal and spatial variation in insecticide resistance detected in this study is not unique. Variations in both phenotypic and genotypic insecticide resistance in both Anopheles Aedes previously

   <sup>40</sup>. A recent report in Chad found a significant spatial changes in insecticide resistance in an An. arabiensis population
   <sup>38</sup>. Similarly, there was significant difference in phenotypic and genotypic resistance at a fine geographical scale in Ae. aegypti sampled from nearby study sites in Mexico
   <sup>39</sup>. The seasonal and spatial fluctuations in insecticide resistance might be attributed to differences in the biology and genetics of the vector populations in particular ecological settings, as reported in a previous study by Verhaeghen et al.
   <sup>40</sup>. Perhaps the presence of chemical contaminants in a particular environment, possibly due to leached agricultural chemicals and other pollutants at a particular time might cause selection pressure in mosquitoes, and subsequent resistance to insecticides. Also, the existence of phenotypic resistance in the study areas to lambda-cyhalothrin, bendiocarb and DDT that are not used for LLINs or IRS, suggest cross-resistance between classes or alternative sources of insecticide resistance pressure, most likely from agriculture. The impact of agricultural pesticides in the selection of resistant mosquitoes has already been reported extensively
   <sup>19</sup>
   <sup>,</sup>
   <sup>41</sup>
   <sup>–</sup>
   <sup>48</sup>. This hypothesis is also supported by our preliminary observations that the majority of farmers in the study villages reported applying more pesticides in dry seasons than in wet seasons (Matowo N, Munhenga G, Tanner M, Koekemoer L, Coetzee M and Okumu F, Institute). The differences in insecticide resistance between adjacent study villages suggests that other than variations that have been reported between districts and regions
   <sup>10</sup>
   <sup>,</sup> might also be fine-scale differences even within the villages that require further investigations. All these variations signify an important challenge to the vector control programs that might require proper consideration in the timing/season and choosing different insecticides for application even in a particular small area. Male mosquitoes are considered to be more delicate and susceptible to insecticides as they have a shorter life expectancy than their females counterparts
   <sup>28</sup>. In this study, males were found to be resistant to the same insecticides as the females, but at a lower level. These observations are consistent with previous studies that have reported that adults male An. arabiensis, with previous exposure to insecticides, could also experience resistance similar to

   <sup>49</sup>. Resistance in male mosquitoes was reported previously to adversely affect their mating competiveness, as shown in Culex pipiensAn. gambiae
   <sup>50</sup>
   <sup>–</sup>
   <sup>52</sup>. This suggests the need for regular monitoring of susceptibility status of male mosquitoes, particularly in interven-tions targeting male mating behaviour, such as the sterile insect technique, which involves mass-rearing, sterilization, and release of sterile male mosquitoes into the wild population to prevent females from reproducing
   <sup>53</sup>
   <sup>,</sup>
   <sup>54</sup>. Other interventions that have been proposed for mosquito-borne disease elimination includes target-ing male swarming behaviour
   <sup>55</sup>, sugar-seeking behaviour through the use of attractive toxic sugar baits
   <sup>56</sup>
   <sup>,</sup>
   <sup>57</sup>
   <sup>58</sup>. In summary, our findings and the current evidence suggest the need for regular monitoring of susceptibility status of both males and females, especially for end-game scenarios where LLINs and IRS have already been widely used, but malaria transmission still per-sists.As revealed in the synergist assays, the reduction in knockdown rates and increase in mortalities was due to synergistic action of piperonal butoxide (PBO), as an inhibitor of P450 monooxygen-ases, and triphenol phosphate (TPP), as an inhibitor of the esterases activity. Synergists have an effect by augmenting the penetration of the insecticides into the mosquito body and counteracting the metabolic pathways that would otherwise metabolize the insec-ticides, thus restoring susceptibility to varying degrees
   <sup>31</sup>
   <sup>,</sup>
   <sup>59</sup>
   <sup>–</sup>The observed effects in the present study suggest involvement to a significant degree of one or both of the two enzyme classes in conferring pyrethroid and bendiocarb resistance within the mosquito populations sampled from the study sites. However, esterases seem not to be involved in deltamethrin and permethrin resistance in the mosquito population sampled from Minepa village. Susceptibility to lambda-cyhalothrin was completely restored by 4% PBO in the mosquito population sampled from Minepa village, indicating that the resistance is metabolic medi-ated by monooxygenases. However, the inability of PBO and TPP to completely reverse the deltamethrin, permethrin and ben-diocarb resistance across the study sites indicates that either other enzymes might be playing a role in the metabolic resistance, or 10,14,15
   <sub>there is presence of other mutations that require further investi-</sub>, there gation. These questions will need to be further explored through biochemical and genetic analyses. Our findings agree with previ-ous studies that have consistently reported the combining effect of synergists and insecticides against resistant disease-transmitting mosquitoes and incomplete suppressions of pyrethroids resistance due to the synergists action

However, these gene mutations were detected in both An. arabiensisAn. gambiae s.s.66 Tanzania where studies were carried out. This study revealed multiple spatial and temporal fluctuations of insecticide resistance profiles in the An. arabiensis from the three neighbouring villages in south-eastern Tanzania, and confirmed the presence of pyrethroid, DDT and bendiocarb resistance in each of these three villages. The substantial, though not absolute reversal of pyrethroid and carbamate resistance when mosquitoes were pre-exposed to PBO or TPP, coupled with the absence of kdr monooxygenases and esterases as key determinants conferring the resistance phenotypes. We recommend further intensity bioassays to determine the strength of phenotypic resistance, as well as biochemical and molecular analysis to elucidate various enzymes involved in the resistance. Such additional tests are essential for an effective resistance management programmes in this or similar areas. Overall, these results highlight the importance of periodic and continuous insecticide susceptibility surveillance and emphasize the need to consider fine-scale variations in insecticide resistance levels, even in small geographical locations, when implementing insecticidal-based interventions.
