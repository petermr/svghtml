Three studies consistently support a positive link between the constructs. Study 1 (<italic>N</italic> = 636) found that higher job satisfaction predicted higher life satisfaction both contemporaneously and longitudinally, and vice versa, above and beyond several key control variables. Study 2 (<italic>N</italic> = 725) and Study 3 (<italic>N</italic> = 703) replicated Study 1 results, but tested for the first time the role of satisfaction of basic psychological needs (as stated by self-determination theory) in the job&#x02013;life satisfaction link. This is the most novel contribution of our paper. Key implications not only for individual quality of life, but also for companies' human resource practices emerge from our findings.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>job satisfaction</kwd><kwd>life satisfaction</kwd><kwd>need satisfaction</kwd><kwd>self-determination theory</kwd><kwd>longitudinal analyses</kwd><kwd>Chile</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient&#x000ed;fico y Tecnol&#x000f3;gico<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002850</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">11160389</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="6"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="65"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="12726"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>How related are job satisfaction and life satisfaction? This question has been extensively explored in the literature (Heller et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The spillover hypothesis (Bowling et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) is the most supported hypothesis to date. It argues that &#x0201c;job experiences spill over onto other spheres of life, and vice versa, suggesting that a positive relationship exists between the two variables&#x0201d; (Heller et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>, p. 816). However, there are still three important research gaps in this area. First, previous research has reported results mainly from the Western world (Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Heller et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Diener and Tay, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Second, most research in the subject is correlational, which does not allow for the inferring of causality (Bowling et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Third, and finally, the lack of research aiming to give a solid theoretical explanation for the results is surprising (Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Judge and Watanabe, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Rode, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). In fact, the underlying psychological mechanisms explaining the hypothesis are still not completely understood.</p><p>Further, aiming to tackle previous limitations, we explored three large samples of workers in Chile (a fast-developing Latin American economy) using both cross-sectional and longitudinal data, which is very rarely done in this field (Rode, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). In addition, because recent research has argued that the link between job satisfaction and life satisfaction might be spurious, and that a third variable could be involved (Judge and Watanabe, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Rode, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), we tested for the first time the mediational role of basic need satisfaction (Deci and Ryan, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) in the job-life satisfaction link.</p><sec><title>Job satisfaction and life satisfaction</title><p>Happiness has been conceptualized from the hedonic and eudaimonic approaches (Delle Fave et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The hedonic approach defines happiness in relation to the attainment of pleasure and the avoidance of pain (Ryan and Deci, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). From this point of view, happiness is often called subjective well-being (Diener, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>), which consists of cognitive (life satisfaction) and emotional (positive and negative emotions) experiences. Life satisfaction represents the judgment that a person makes about his/her life in several domains (Diener, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>; Diener and Tay, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and it is the most extended construct for assessing subjective well-being (Helliwell et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). A growing body of research has shown that higher life satisfaction is associated with several desirable companies' results, such as higher career satisfaction, organizational commitment, and especially, job satisfaction (Diener and Tay, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Job satisfaction is a key construct in industrial and organizational psychology, and has been associated with multiple desirable outcomes such as job performance, organizational citizenship behavior, absenteeism, and life satisfaction (Heller et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Erdogan et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Most definitions of job satisfaction tend to focus on how employees feel and think about their work (Locke, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">1969</xref>; Smith et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">1969</xref>; Weiss, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Drafke, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). These definitions, in a very similar way to those of life satisfaction, involve emotional states, feelings, affective responses, and cognitive evaluations of work (Alonso, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p><p>Three hypotheses have been argued to explain the link between job satisfaction and life satisfaction: the segmentation, compensation, and spillover hypotheses (Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Heller et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Bowling et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The segmentation hypothesis</title><p>The segmentation hypothesis suggests that there is no relationship between job satisfaction and life satisfaction. Theoretical positions such as <italic>partial inclusion</italic> have been proposed to explain the link between both concepts from this perspective (for a review see Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). However, only one study supported this hypothesis in the meta-analysis by Rain et al. (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). Indeed, Gupta and Beehr (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>) found more support for the segmentation hypothesis than for the compensation and spillover ones, among 651 employees of five Midwestern organizations. According to the authors, these findings show that work (e.g., job satisfaction) and non-work aspects (e.g., life satisfaction) load on separate factors.</p></sec><sec><title>The compensation hypothesis</title><p>The compensation hypothesis states that people compensate for their job dissatisfaction by finding more satisfaction in other areas of their life, and vice versa (Iris and Barrett, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>). Thus, a negative relationship is postulated. Theoretical positions such as the <italic>principle of substitution</italic> and <italic>catharsis theory</italic> have been proposed to explain this hypothesis (Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). Very few studies, however, have supported it (e.g., Champoux, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>; Chacko, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; Schlenker and Gutek, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; for a review see Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). For example, Schlenker and Gutek (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>) studied 132 government-employed social workers. Half of them were reassigned to non-professional jobs, and this allowed understanding the impact of their dissatisfaction with the new job on their life satisfaction. The authors found that their discontent because of their work role-loss focused on their new jobs instead of on their satisfaction with life, thus supporting the compensation hypothesis. Chacko (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>) studied a US national probability sample, which was representative of the American labor force. The authors found that satisfaction with working conditions was a negative source of life satisfaction, thus also supporting the compensation hypothesis.</p></sec><sec><title>The spillover hypothesis</title><p>The spillover hypothesis argues that there is a positive relationship between job satisfaction and life satisfaction. Theoretical explanations such as <italic>generalization</italic> of belief and attitudes, <italic>conditioning</italic>, and <italic>cognitive dissonance</italic> have been given to explain it (Tait et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). To date, the spillover hypothesis is by far the most supported one in the literature. Meta-analytic techniques and literature reviews confirm these findings (Rice et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>; Tait et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Bowling et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). For example, a meta-analysis by Rice et al. (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>) explored 350 associations between job satisfaction and overall life satisfaction reported in 23 studies. More than 90% of the 350 statistical relationships supported a positive correlation. However, the reported zero-order correlations were mostly small (mid &#x02212;0.30 for males and mid &#x02013;0.20 for females), and none of the negative correlations they found was statistically significant.</p><p>The Tait et al. (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>) meta-analysis also confirmed that the spillover hypothesis is the most evidence-backed one. They explored 34 studies assessing the link between job and life satisfaction, but the authors found larger correlations than Rice et al. (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>). The corrected correlation (for both sampling error and measurement error) was 0.44. Importantly, whereas the corrected correlation was greater for men (<italic>r</italic> = 0.40) than for women (<italic>r</italic> = 0.20) in studies prior to 1974, the difference between men (<italic>r</italic> = 0.37) and women (<italic>r</italic> = 0.39) disappeared in studies after that year. Demographic changes among women, and the role of work in their lives, may explain these findings.</p></sec><sec><title>The causal direction of the link between job satisfaction and life satisfaction</title><p>Despite the strong empirical support for the spillover hypothesis, most research to date is correlational in nature, which does not allow for the inferring of causality. Does life satisfaction predict job satisfaction or vice-versa? Would a bi-directional link be possible? Unfortunately, only a few studies to date have explored cause&#x02013;effect patterns, and even these have mostly done so under the assumption that either job satisfaction or life satisfaction are dependent variables. For example, whereas Schmitt and Mellon (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>) showed that only life satisfaction predicts job satisfaction, Orpen (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">1978</xref>) and Chacko (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>) showed that only job satisfaction causes life satisfaction (Judge and Watanabe, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). Thus, there are hardly any studies that explore and show a reciprocal link (Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Judge and Watanabe, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). Nonetheless, a bi-directional link may be expected, thus making previous results inconsistent with the theory.</p><sec><title>The causal influence of life satisfaction in job satisfaction: the top-down model</title><p>The link between job satisfaction and life satisfaction can be interpreted in two ways: top-down vs. bottom-up models. The top-down model offers a dispositional explanation, claiming that &#x0201c;basic differences in personality and affectivity predispose people to be differentially satisfied with various aspects of their lives, including their jobs&#x0201d; (Heller et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>, p. 816). Thus, affective states spillover into people's evaluations of their jobs (Judge and Watanabe, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>, p. 939). In fact, a substantial body of research has shown that higher life satisfaction is associated with several desirable results for companies, such as higher career satisfaction, organizational commitment, and&#x02014;of interest here&#x02014;job satisfaction (Diener and Tay, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The causal influence of job satisfaction on life satisfaction: the bottom-up model</title><p>Job satisfaction is a key indicator of workers' well-being (Diener and Tay, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and therefore can also influence life satisfaction (Judge et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Thus, the bottom-up model suggests a situational explanation. That is, &#x0201c;because the job is an important part of adult daily life, people who enjoy their jobs will report greater overall satisfaction with their lives&#x0201d; (Heller et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>, p. 816). Indeed, research has consistently found that higher job satisfaction is associated with higher life satisfaction (Rice et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>; Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). This causal influence of job satisfaction on life satisfaction reflects the importance of work in people's lives, and is the most hypothesized direction of the link (Judge and Watanabe, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The bi-directional link between job satisfaction and life satisfaction</title><p>The relationship between job and life satisfaction is likely not only to be a one-way direction, but also reciprocal. Thus, a bi-directional link may be expected (Heller et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). However, only a few exceptions have explored and found reverse causality (Keon and McDonald, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>; Judge and Watanabe, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). For example, Keon and McDonald (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>) found that job satisfaction and life satisfaction were jointly determined among employees of an auto parts manufacturer in the US. Judge and Watanabe (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) tested a causal model exploring bi-directional associations between job and life satisfaction, over a 5-year period, and controlling for several exogenous influences on life satisfaction (such as age, gender, education, wage rate, and marital status). Based on a national probability sample of US workers, they found that job and life satisfaction were significantly and reciprocally related both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. However, due to the small amount of research on this, and various limitations in the previous studies, scholars have advocated for more longitudinal research in the field exploring causality and the bi-directional link (Judge and Watanabe, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Rode, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Finally, the meta-analysis by Bowling et al. (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) explored longitudinally the association between job satisfaction and subjective well-being. Despite the authors having found a reciprocal causal link between the constructs, the subjective well-being measure did not assess life satisfaction independently. The composite subjective well-being measure included not only life satisfaction, but also positive affect, happiness, and negative affect.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Individual differences in the link between job satisfaction and life satisfaction: moderators and mediators</title><p>To date, the great majority of previous research has supported the spillover hypothesis. However, what are the underlying psychological processes behind the link between job satisfaction and life satisfaction? Unfortunately, most studies have not advocated a theoretical proposition (Kabanoff, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>; Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>), and the three hypotheses approach seems too simplistic (Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). Indeed, researchers have suggested that more than one relationship between job satisfaction and life satisfaction may operate at any given time point, and that the three hypotheses &#x0201c;may exist for different individuals&#x0201d; (Heller et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>, p. 816). Thus, more studies exploring different mediators and moderators are needed (Rice et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>; Tait et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). Initially, the focus was on the moderator role of gender (Tait et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). However, other potential moderators (such as age, self-employment, locus of control, importance of work, need for achievement) have been suggested later on, but either they are not all consistent or they have not been tested yet (for a review see Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>).</p><p>Nobel research has proposed another look at the job&#x02013;life satisfaction link. For example, it has been suggested that &#x0201c;much of the relationship between job satisfaction and life satisfaction is spurious, resulting from common influences&#x0201d; (Rode, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>, p. 1206). Therefore, a third or confounding or mediator variable could be involved (Heller et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Following this theorization, Heller et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) explored the role of personality (Big Five, positive/negative affectivity, and core self-evaluations) in the link between job satisfaction and life satisfaction. Using a longitudinal design among US employees, and multisource data, the authors found support for the confounding role of personality, especially core self-evaluations (neuroticism, locus of control, self-esteem, and generalized self-efficacy). After controlling for personality, the magnitude of the association between job and life satisfaction decreased significantly, suggesting the presence of a third variable involved.</p><p>However, despite the importance and novelty of these results, they need to be treated with caution, due to some limitations. First, despite the fact that Heller et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) argued that their design was longitudinal, it is correlational in nature. A suitable longitudinal model needs to include all relevant T1 and T2 variables in the same model and modeling the stability paths, which in their study was not the case. Second, the authors did not test reciprocal causality: in their first two models, they assumed that job satisfaction precedes life satisfaction, while in the latter two models they took the opposite approach, meaning that life satisfaction precedes job satisfaction.</p><p>In another study, Rode (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) replicated the findings of Heller et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Using a nationally representative US sample, the author tested a comprehensive model examining the relationship between job satisfaction, life satisfaction and core self-evaluations and found a positive relationship between job satisfaction and life satisfaction over time. Interestingly, the link became non-significant after controlling for the effects of core self-evaluations. Similarly to Heller et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), Rode's (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) findings present some limitations. First, the author only measured life satisfaction at time 1 (T1) and core self-evaluations at time 2 (T2). Therefore, although he argued the model is a longitudinal cross-lagged one, it is only cross-sectional in nature. A suitable cross-lagged model needs to include lagged paths from each relevant measure (e.g., life satisfaction, job satisfaction) at T1 to all relevant measures at T2, controlling for stability effects (i.e., all constructs need to be represented as potential antecedents and as potential consequences of all other constructs).</p><p>Previous results have given initial empirical support to the idea that the link between job satisfaction and life satisfaction may be spurious, and that a third variable could be involved. However, those studies only focused on personality and affectivity variables, without exploring other constructs. We hypothesize that the satisfaction of basic psychological needs as proposed by self-determination theory (Deci and Ryan, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) may also play a key role in the job&#x02013;life satisfaction link. Initial evidence may be found in Hombrados-Mendieta and Cosano-Rivas (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and Di Fabio and Kenny (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2016a</xref>). Hombrados-Mendieta and Cosano-Rivas (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) found that workplace support (a proxy of the need for relatedness) protects job satisfaction and life satisfaction against the negative effects of burnout. Di Fabio and Kenny (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2016a</xref>) stated that the need for relationship and the need for self-determination (a proxy of the need for autonomy) are crucial for workers' well-being. These preliminary results allow us to hypothesize that need satisfaction may mediate the relationship between job satisfaction and life satisfaction.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of basic psychological needs in the job&#x02013;life satisfaction link</title><p>Self-determination theory (Deci and Ryan, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) is a &#x0201c;macro theory of human motivation, emotion and personality&#x0201d; (Vansteenkiste et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, p. 105). It states that human beings have three psychological needs&#x02014;autonomy, competence, and relatedness&#x02014;which are essential for psychological well-being and integration. Just as plants need essential nutrients, such as water and minerals, so people have essential needs too (Reis et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>).</p><p>The need for <italic>autonomy</italic> (DeCharms, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>) refers to the perception that our behavior is volitional and meaningful; the need for <italic>competence</italic> (White, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">1959</xref>) refers to feeling effective and efficient in our behavior, as well as being able to successfully manage difficult challenges and meet performance standards; the need for <italic>relatedness</italic> (Baumeister and Leary, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>) refers to feeling connected, appreciated and understood by others who are important (Vansteenkiste et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Unanue et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Therefore, feeling able to decide what to do and that these actions are valuable and enjoyable (<italic>autonomy</italic>); feeling good at daily activities (<italic>competence</italic>); and having meaningful and deep relationships with people who is important to us (<italic>relatedness</italic>) are the key nutrients for people flourishing (Deci and Ryan, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>).</p><p>A substantial amount of research has supported the self-determination theory claims, showing that satisfaction of psychological needs is significantly associated with higher well-being both in general life and at work. For example, in everyday life settings, Unanue et al. (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) showed that higher need satisfaction <italic>in life settings</italic> is associated with higher well-being (e.g., life satisfaction, vitality and positive affect) and lower ill-being (physical symptoms, negative affect and depressive symptoms). These findings have been replicated across the lifespan, as well as cross-culturally (Chen et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In job settings, a recent meta-analysis (Van den Broeck et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), reviewing 99 studies with 119 distinct samples, found that the satisfaction of basic psychological needs <italic>at work</italic> is significantly associated not only with higher well-being (e.g., life satisfaction) but also with several desirable organizational outcomes (e.g., job satisfaction).</p><p>Previous findings allow us to hypothesize that the link between job satisfaction and life satisfaction may be spurious, and instead is rooted in basic needs satisfaction. This is because both job satisfaction and life satisfaction seem to be dispositionally based, and the same characteristics that predict one construct (job satisfaction) also predict the other (life satisfaction) (Heller et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The role of psychological needs was suggested more than 30 years ago (Champoux, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>; Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). However, it has not been tested until now.</p><p>Therefore, in our research, we explore the confounding influence of basic need satisfaction (Deci and Ryan, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) on the link between job and life satisfaction. Because need satisfaction in life settings as well as at work predict well-being, our research will test both kinds of need satisfaction in the mentioned link.</p></sec><sec><title>Research gaps: justification for the present research</title><p>As mentioned before, meta-analytic techniques and literature reviews confirm that the spillover hypothesis is the most supported explanation for the link between job and life satisfaction. However, several methodological and theoretical research gaps have emerged in the field (Tait et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Heller et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>).</p><p>In methodological terms, there are two aspects that need to be improved: samples and design (Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). First, most research so far has focused on samples from the Western world<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0001"><sup>1</sup></xref>. Therefore, culture has not been taken into account. Nonetheless, cross-cultural research has shown that cultural aspects might influence several links (Thomas and Au, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Thomas and Pekerti, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Moreover, recent research has shown that the effects of happiness (such as life satisfaction) may be specific to some individualistic cultures (Ford et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Such findings raise the question of whether the associations between job and life satisfaction found in the Western world are also held in different populations with different demographic characteristics, like Chile (Heller et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>).</p><p>Second, most designs are still correlational in nature, and reciprocal causality has not been extensively explored using suitable cross-lagged models (Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Judge and Watanabe, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Rode, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). In theoretical terms, and in spite of the spillover hypothesis receiving most of the empirical support, no satisfactory theoretical explanation has been offered (Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). Indeed, research so far has done little to test the underlying psychological process behind the link (Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Judge and Watanabe, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>).</p><sec><title>Job satisfaction research in Chile</title><p>Data on well-being has only appeared recently in Latin America (Montero and V&#x000e1;squez, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and there is only one paper in which the job-life satisfaction link in Chile is studied: Loewe et al. (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Loewe et al. (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) found support for the spillover hypothesis, showing that Chilean workers attribute most importance to their financial &#x0201c;situation, followed by family, work, and health&#x0201d; (p. 80). However, several limitations emerge from the paper. For example, it is correlational in nature and neither alternative models nor causality was tested. In addition, no underlying mechanisms for explaining the job-life satisfaction link were tested.</p><p>A few additional researchers have explored job satisfaction in Chile. For example, Cassar (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) studied a representative sample of the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) database, and found that the degree of employment protection, workplace facilities and level of independence were positively associated with job satisfaction. Using the same data set, Montero and Rau (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) found a positive relationship between salaries and job satisfaction, while Montero and V&#x000e1;squez (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) showed the impact of reference wages on job satisfaction. Finally, using the CASEN survey (National Socio-Economic Characterization Survey) and OPHI, Montero and Rau (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) found that part-time work has a negative effect on job and life satisfaction for men, but a positive effect for women. The above-mentioned represent a notable contribution to the job satisfaction literature in Chile. Nonetheless, these studies suffer from certain limitations. They are cross-sectional in nature, they did not explore the underlying psychological process, and more importantly, they did not test the link between job satisfaction and life satisfaction.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Summary of aims and predictions</title><p>With the aim of tackling previous research gaps, we conducted three different studies among Chilean workers. We had three objectives in mind. First, to test whether the cross-sectional positive link (spillover hypothesis) between job and life satisfaction found in the Western world is held among workers from Chile, controlling for several key confounding variables not assessed to date. Second, because the great majority of past research has been carried out using cross-sectional analyses, we used longitudinal designs to test a possible bi-directional causal link between the core variables. Third, and finally, for the first time a comprehensive model was tested. It allowed us to examine the relationship between job and life satisfaction over time while taking into account the possible confounding role of a third variable: basic psychological needs.</p><p>Chile is a country with increasing mental health problems at work (MINSAL, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Indeed, the Ministry of Labour in Chile warns that Chilean employees are in danger of serious psychological problems at work (Mutual de Seguridad, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). By understanding the job-life satisfaction dynamic we aim to help companies to develop strategies not only for protecting their employees' mental health, but also for improving employees' quality of life and happiness. In addition, because of the close link between life/job satisfaction and productivity, our findings may help to improve companies' profitability and sustainability (Diener and Tay, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Montero and V&#x000e1;squez, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Further, based on the previous evidence, we tested the following hypotheses:

All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Adolfo Ib&#x000e1;&#x000f1;ez University.</p><p>At baseline (June 2016; T1), participants were invited online to take part in a research project where the core measures for the present paper were collected (job satisfaction and life satisfaction)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0002"><sup>2</sup></xref>. Two months later (August 2016; T2), the same participants were asked to complete another online survey with identical measures. Initially, respondents were sent an introductory email containing a brief description of the study, along with a web link to the survey created using Qualtrics software.</p><p>Following Simmons et al.'s (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) guidelines, all target sample sizes were determined in advance in Study 1, and in all further studies. Using a power analysis with G<sup>*</sup>Power 3.1 (Faul et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), considering a hypothesized small effect size (0.18; Bosco et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), power of 0.80, and <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.05, the desired sample was estimated as a minimum of <italic>N</italic> = 187. Both our cross-sectional data at T1 (<italic>N</italic> = 636) and T2 (<italic>N</italic> = 268), and our longitudinal data (<italic>N</italic> = 210), fulfill the required sample size. This minimum sample size (<italic>N</italic> = 187) also applies to Study 2 and Study 3.</p><p>We followed a key rule for collecting T1 data. We informed participants that the online system would be open for only 3 days (due to the original design of Unanue et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Participants were informed that the project was part of a longitudinal study and were asked for their consent in participating in future waves. All T1 participants were sent a further email in August 2016 (T2). The rule for collecting T2 data was only slightly different. To be able to find reasonable effect sizes, we considered that it would be important to recruit a large sample aiming to reach a power of 0.80 both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.</p><p>Almost all constructs used in Study 1 showed acceptable distributions (George and Mallery, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Skew values were acceptable for life satisfaction (T1: &#x02212;1.45; T2: &#x02212;0.05) and job satisfaction (T1: &#x02212;1.2; T2: &#x02212;1.03). Kurtosis values were acceptable for job satisfaction (T1: 1.75; T2: 1.34). In the case of life satisfaction, Kurtosis values were acceptable at T2 (0.58), but not at T1 (4.41).</p></sec><sec><title>Sample</title><p>In total, 636 Chilean working adults (52.8% female) aged from 22 to 71 years (Mean age = 39.76; <italic>SD</italic> = 8.61) finished the whole survey and completed our T1 measures. Of them, 475 (74.69%) provided their e-mail address for future waves. At T2, 268 participants (55.6% female) aged from 20 to 80 years (Mean age = 40.47; <italic>SD</italic> = 10.73) answered our core measures (56.42% response rate). Finally, 210 workers (56.2% female) aged from 23 to 71 years (Mean age = 40.16; <italic>SD</italic> = 9.17) answered both waves.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0003"><sup>3</sup></xref></p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>We used the following measures for Study 1.</p><sec><title>Job satisfaction</title><p>We used a single question: &#x0201c;All in all, how satisfied are you with your job?&#x0201d; Participants answered on an 11-point scale, ranging from &#x0201c;extremely unsatisfied&#x0201d; (0) to &#x0201c;extremely satisfied&#x0201d; (10). Meta-analytic analysis demonstrated that this single question is highly valid for measuring job satisfaction (Dolbier et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Life satisfaction</title><p>We used a single question: &#x0201c;All in all, how satisfied are you with your life?&#x0201d; Participants answered on an 11-point scale, ranging from &#x0201c;extremely unsatisfied&#x0201d; (0) to &#x0201c;extremely satisfied&#x0201d; (10). This question is the most extensive single item question designed to measure life satisfaction, and it has shown good psychometric properties (Helliwell et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Demographic variables</title><p>At T1, we asked participants to report their age and gender status. However, at T2, we asked participants also to report additional demographic variables such as education, economic sector (mining, transport, etc.), working area (marketing, finance, etc.), managerial functions (whether or not they lead people), monthly personal income, and monthly family income. Our results showed that participants who answered both waves differed in several demographic characteristics such as education (high school education 5.71%, Bachelors degree 31.90%, post-graduate degree 61.43%, other 0.95%); economic sector (health and social services 18.10%, education 14.76%, commerce 7.62%, community services 5.71%, public sector 4.76%, mining 4.29%, financial services 3.81%, manufacturing 3.81%, transport 3.81%, others 33.33%); working area (accounting 0.95%, technology 1.90%, administration 4.29%, finance 5.71%, operations 7.14%, marketing 6.19%, human resources 36.20%, others 37.62%); managerial positions (58%); net personal monthly average income (mean = US$ 5,789.30; <italic>SD</italic> = 3,664.30); and net family monthly average income (US$1,853.10; <italic>SD</italic> = 1,396.30). As stated by Judge and Watanabe (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>), what is crucial when studying the link between job and life satisfaction is &#x0201c;the use of extensive controls derived from past theory and research&#x0201d;, the lack of which was a limitation in previous studies (p. 940). Thus, we aimed to tackle this limitation by using our extensive number of control variables.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>All constructs of interest were measured at T1 and T2.

Here, we controlled for age and gender, but also for education, economic sector, working area, managerial functions, net monthly personal income, and net monthly family income. A two-factor model where each T2 measure was regressed on both its own lagged measure as well as the other lagged measures was defined. We allowed the observed measures to covary within each time point. Thus, all constructs were represented as potential antecedents and as potential consequences of all other constructs, while controlling for stability effects. Values of <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> were also acceptable (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) ranging from 0.49 (life satisfaction) to 0.43 (job satisfaction) (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

Supporting the spillover hypothesis (Tait et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Bowling et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), we found a cross-sectional and causal positive bi-directional link between job satisfaction and life satisfaction among workers from Chile. Importantly, the correlational and longitudinal links were found while controlling for several demographic and confounding variables not assessed in previous research (age, gender, education, marital status, salary, etc.). Indeed, Judge and Watanabe (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) argued that when studying the link between job and life satisfaction, the use of extensive controls is crucial. Indeed, our results suggest taking into account the demographic variables as control variables when studying the job-life satisfaction link. Finally, it is worth mentioning that a limitation of Study 1 design is that it did not allow testing a third variable that may be driving the mentioned link. Thus, in Study 2 we tested the confounding influence of need satisfaction at work, whereas in Study 3 we tested the confounding influence of need satisfaction in general life setting.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Study 2</title><sec><title>Method</title><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Study 2 followed the same ethical rules as Study 1. We utilized a cross-lagged longitudinal design with 4 weeks between the two observations and a wide sample of Chilean worker adults. At the baseline (September 2016; T1), participants were invited online to take part in a research project where the core measures for the present paper were collected (job satisfaction, life satisfaction and need satisfaction at work<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0004"><sup>4</sup></xref>). A university in Santiago provided a mailing list for both Study 2 and Study 3. Participants were informed that the project was part of a longitudinal study and were asked for their consent to participate in future waves. Four weeks later (October 2016; T2), the same participants were asked to complete another online survey with identical measures. Respondents received an introductory email containing a brief description of the study, along with a web link to the survey created using Qualtrics software.</p><p>We followed a key rule for collecting T1 and T2 data. The survey was kept open for only 1 week, and every working day a polite reminder was sent to those respondents who had not answered. Both our cross-sectional data at T1 (<italic>N</italic> = 725) and T2 (<italic>N</italic> = 275), and our longitudinal data (<italic>N</italic> = 274) fulfilled the required minimum sample size according to our power analysis mentioned previously.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample</title><p>In total, 725 Chilean worker adults (47.9% female) aged from 21 to 72 years (Mean age = 38.03; <italic>SD</italic> = 10.01) finished the whole survey and completed our T1 measures. At T2, 275 participants (47.3% female) aged from 21 to 72 years (Mean age = 39.69; <italic>SD</italic> = 10.24) answered our core measures (37.93% response rate). Finally, 274 workers (47.1% female) aged from 21 to 72 years (Mean age = 39.75; <italic>SD</italic> = 10.20) answered both waves.</p><p>All constructs used in Study 2 showed acceptable distributions (George and Mallery, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Skew values were acceptable for life satisfaction (T1: &#x02212;1.14; T2: &#x02212;0.98), job satisfaction (T1: &#x02212;0.69; T2: &#x02212;0.91) and need satisfaction at work (T1: &#x02212;0.53; T2: 0.62). Kurtosis values were acceptable for life satisfaction (T1: 1.53; T2: 0.91), job satisfaction (T1: &#x02212;0.13; T2: 0.62) and need satisfaction at work (T1: 0.09; T2: &#x02212;0.04).</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>Job satisfaction and life satisfaction were measured using the same single items used in Study 1. However, in this study, the job satisfaction question was answered on a scale from 1 to 7. Need satisfaction was measured using the Satisfaction items of the Need Satisfaction and Frustration scales adapted to the work context (Chen et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The satisfaction subscale included 12 items: four for autonomy (&#x0201c;I feel my choices on my job express who I really am&#x0201d;), four for competence (&#x0201c;At work, I feel capable at what I do&#x0201d;), and four for relatedness (&#x0201c;At work, I feel connected with people who care for me, and for whom I care&#x0201d;). Participants rated these statements on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from <italic>1 (not at all true)</italic> to <italic>7 (very true)</italic>. The internal reliability of the need satisfaction scale was good, both at T1 (&#x003b1; = 0.90) and T2 (&#x003b1; = 0.90). Chen et al.'s (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) scale has shown good psychometric properties and demonstrated that the items load in a single factor. Thus, we calculated a need satisfaction mean score by averaging its 12 indicators.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>All constructs were measured at T1 and T2.

At T1 (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>), we found that job satisfaction was significantly and positively related to life satisfaction, &#x003b2; = 0.30, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001. Thus, H1 was supported at T1. Then, to test H3, we included need satisfaction in the model. We allowed need satisfaction to predict both job and life satisfaction. We found that need satisfaction was positively associated with both life satisfaction, &#x003b2; = 0.40, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, and job satisfaction, &#x003b2; = 0.64, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001. In support of H3, when need satisfaction was included in the model, the path between life and job satisfaction becomes non-significant, &#x003b2; = 0.06, <italic>p</italic> = 0.09 (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">2</xref>). At T2 (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>), we found that job satisfaction was significantly and positively associated with life satisfaction, &#x003b2; = 0.40, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001. Thus, H1 was also supported at T2. Then, to test H3, we included need satisfaction in the model. We found that need satisfaction was positively associated with both life satisfaction, &#x003b2; = 0.42, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, and job satisfaction, &#x003b2; = 0.74, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">2</xref>). In support of H3, when need satisfaction was included in the model, the path between life satisfaction and job satisfaction, although still significant, decreased by almost half of its original value, &#x003b2; = 0.16, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.10.</p></sec><sec><title>Longitudinal analysis</title><p>First, we started with a structural cross-lagged reciprocal model for our core variables (job and life satisfaction), following the same strategy as for Study 1. Second, we allowed the three measures to covary within each time point, and we modeled lagged paths from each of the three measures to all three measures at each successive time point. Therefore, all constructs were represented both as potential antecedents and potential consequences of all other constructs, while controlling for stability effects. Supporting H2, we found that job satisfaction was a positive prospective predictor of life satisfaction, &#x003b2; = 0.09, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, and that life satisfaction was a significant and positive prospective predictor of job satisfaction, &#x003b2; = 0.14, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> was good for job satisfaction (0.43) and life satisfaction (0.53). Given the important role hypothesized by need satisfaction at work in the job-life satisfaction relationship, we tested a structural model to establish whether need satisfaction influenced both variables (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In this new model, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> was good for job satisfaction (0.50), life satisfaction (0.53), and need satisfaction at work (0.62). We found that need satisfaction at work was a significant and positive prospective predictor of job satisfaction, &#x003b2; = 0.35, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 and that life satisfaction was a significant and positive prospective predictor of need satisfaction at work, &#x003b2; = 0.08, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05. They were the only significant paths. Importantly, after controlling for need satisfaction at work, the reciprocal link between job satisfaction and life satisfaction becomes non-significant, supporting H3. Indeed, job satisfaction did not predict life satisfaction longitudinally, &#x003b2; = 0.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.17 and similarly, life satisfaction did not predict job satisfaction longitudinally, &#x003b2; = 0.06, <italic>p</italic> = 0.13 when controlling for need satisfaction at work.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Study 2</bold>.

More importantly, taking a bottom-up approach (Diener and Tay, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), we found that the cross-sectional and longitudinal links between job satisfaction and life satisfaction was mediated by need satisfaction at work (Deci and Ryan, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). This key finding supports H3. However, despite the important results of Study 2, it only tested the confounding role of need satisfaction in job settings. Thus, Study 3 is aimed to test the role of need satisfaction in general life settings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Study 3</title><sec><title>Method</title><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Study 3 followed the same ethical rules as Study 1 and Study 2. We used a cross-lagged longitudinal design with 4 weeks between the two observations and a sample of Chilean working adults. At the baseline (September 2016; T1), participants were invited online to take part in a research project including the core measures for the present paper (job satisfaction, life satisfaction and need satisfaction <italic>in life</italic><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0005"><sup>5</sup></xref>). Participants were informed that the project was part of a longitudinal study and were asked for their consent to participate in future waves. All T1 participants were sent a further email in October 2016 (T2). Thus, 4 weeks later (October 2016; T2), the same participants were asked to complete another online survey with identical measures. Respondents were sent an introductory email containing a brief description of the study, along with a web link to the survey created using Qualtrics software.</p><p>We followed the same rules as in Study 1 for collecting T1 and T2 data. Both our cross-sectional data at T1 (<italic>N</italic> = 703) and T2 (<italic>N</italic> = 263), and our longitudinal data (<italic>N</italic> = 258) fulfilled the required minimum sample size according to the power analysis.</p><p>Almost all constructs used in Study 3 showed acceptable distributions (George and Mallery, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).

Kurtosis values were acceptable for life satisfaction (T1: 2.06; T2: 2.68), job satisfaction (T1: 0.24; T2: &#x02212;0.01). However, Kurtosis values for need satisfaction in life were acceptable at T1 (1.86), but not at T2 (4.37).</p></sec><sec><title>Sample</title><p>In total, 703 Chilean working adults (43.2% female) aged from 21 to 69 years (Mean age = 38.45; <italic>SD</italic> = 9.59) finished the whole survey and completed our T1 measures. At T2, 263 participants (44.5% female) aged from 23 to 68 years (Mean age = 39.32; <italic>SD</italic> = 9.72) answered our core measures (37.41% response rate).

Second, we allowed the three measures to covary within each time point, and we modeled lagged paths from each of the three measures to all three measures at each successive time point. Thus, all constructs were represented as potential antecedents and consequences of all other constructs, while controlling for stability effects. Supporting H2, we found that job satisfaction was a positive prospective predictor of life satisfaction, &#x003b2; = 0.08, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, and that life satisfaction was a significant and positive prospective predictor of job satisfaction, &#x003b2; = 0.18, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> was good for job satisfaction (0.56) and life satisfaction (0.70).

In this model, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> was good for job satisfaction (0.60), life satisfaction (0.72), and need satisfaction (0.71).

In addition, taking a top-down approach (Heller et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), it was found that the cross-sectional and causal bi-directional positive link between job satisfaction and life satisfaction is rooted in need satisfaction in life (Deci and Ryan, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). This key finding supports H4.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>General discussion</title><p>So, returning to our initial question&#x02014;Are job satisfaction and life satisfaction related?&#x02014;we can say that despite the limitations of previous research, three hypotheses have emerged to explain their possible association (Rain et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Heller et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>, p. 288): the segmentation, compensation, and spillover hypotheses. The segmentation hypothesis suggests that there is no association between both variables. The compensation hypothesis states that either high job satisfaction or high life satisfaction compensates for the dissatisfaction in the other area (i.e., there is a negative association). Finally, the spillover hypothesis claims that both variables are positively associated. We have tested these hypotheses through three studies involving both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis among workers in Chile.</p><p>Consistently, Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3 showed that job satisfaction and life satisfaction are positively related both cross-sectionally and longitudinally bi-directionally, thus supporting the spillover hypothesis. Study 1 found that job satisfaction predicts increases in life satisfaction, which in turn predict increases in job satisfaction, and vice versa, thereby creating a virtuous circle in both individual and organizational well-being. Importantly, the link holds when controlling for age, gender, education, economic sector, working area, managerial functions, net monthly personal income, and net monthly family income. Thus, Study 1 aimed to approach Judge and Watanabe (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) suggestion. He stated that when studying the link between job and life satisfaction, the use of extensive controls is crucial. Studies 2 and 3 replicated the findings of Study 1 in independent samples. Therefore, our results support the spillover hypothesis in the case of Chile and also show that this relationship is bi-directional.</p><p>However, a novel contribution of our research is the fact that the association between job satisfaction and life satisfaction may be spurious, and that a third variable could have an effect: basic need satisfaction (Deci and Ryan, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Across two longitudinal studies (Studies 2 and 3), we can see that when need satisfaction is included at the same time as job satisfaction and life satisfaction, the job-life satisfaction bi-directional link becomes non-significant over time. These results were found using both a bottom-up approach (Study 2: need satisfaction <italic>at work</italic>) and a top-down approach (Study 3: need satisfaction <italic>in general life settings</italic>). This &#x0201c;spurious association&#x0201d; hypothesis has been proposed before (Heller et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Rode, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), but only with regard to personality variables as mediators (e.g., Big Five, core self-evaluations). However, our research is the first attempt to test the role of the psychological needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness as stated by self-determination theory (Deci and Ryan, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). The results show that need satisfaction plays a key role in the process. Thus, our results support previous theorizations and findings in that a third variable may be driving the job-life satisfaction link.</p><p>Studying Chile allows us to extend previous research mostly done in the Western world. Our aim is for our results to be able to help companies to develop strategies not only for protecting their employees' mental health, but also for improving the employees' quality of life and happiness. Indeed, this issue is especially important in Chile, a country where the Ministry of Labor has recently warned that employees are in danger of serious mental health problems (Mutual de Seguridad, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In addition, as mentioned previously, due the strong link between life/job satisfaction and productivity, we hope our findings may also help companies to increase their profitability and sustainability (Diener and Tay, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Montero and V&#x000e1;squez, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><sec><title>Practical implications for people and organizations</title><p>What can be drawn from our research? Job satisfaction and life satisfaction are strongly related to several desirable outcomes both in life and at work (Diener and Tay, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). For example, whereas job satisfaction has been associated with higher job performance, organizational citizenship behavior and life satisfaction and lower absenteeism and turnover intentions (Heller et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Erdogan et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), life satisfaction has been associated with higher career satisfaction, organizational commitment and job satisfaction (Diener and Tay, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Our results show a key mechanism which companies may use if they wish to have happier and more engaged and productive workers: organizations should help employees to satisfy their psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Further, companies should help workers to feel that their behavior is volitional and meaningful (autonomy satisfaction); that they are effective and efficient in their behavior (competence satisfaction) and feel connected, appreciated and understood by important others (relatedness satisfaction) as stated by self-determination theory (Deci and Ryan, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Van den Broeck et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, helping workers to feel that they are able to decide what to do, as well as feeling good at daily activities, and having meaningful and deep relationships with people who is important for them, are key nutrients for satisfying their psychological needs, making them more satisfied not only with their lives, but also with their jobs (Deci and Ryan, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Van den Broeck et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Thus, when companies help employees to satisfy their needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness, organizations might start a virtuous circle of flourishing both in employees' lives and at work. However, a vicious circle is also possible. If employees feel low need satisfaction, or even worse, feel that their psychological needs are frustrated (Unanue et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Van den Broeck et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), companies may start a dangerous circle of employees' unhappiness.</p><p>Despite previous arguments supporting the importance of need satisfaction, recent research by Di Fabio and colleagues (Di Fabio and Palazzeschi, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Di Fabio and Kenny, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2016a</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>) has highlighted the importance of other employees' psychological resources (life resources and job resources) for promoting both job satisfaction and life satisfaction. Di Fabio and Kenny (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2016a</xref>) recognize that decent work and well-being require the needs for &#x0201c;power, relationship, and self-determination&#x0201d; to be satisfied (similarly to self-determination theory postulates). However, there are a set of additional flexible life and work skills that also need to be developed. In work settings, for example, career management and self-management skills are crucial (e.g., maintaining their employability, intentionality, life-long learning, autobiographical reasoning, meaning-making, and building resilience). In life settings, for example, the development of self and reflexivity are additional key elements in this process. Further, the authors developed the <italic>Positive Self and Relational Management</italic> (PS&#x00026;RM) model and found that Positive Lifelong Life Management (e.g., hedonic and eudaimonic well-being), Positive Lifelong Self-Management (e.g., individual level resources and self-insight in the work context), and Positive Lifelong Relational Management (e.g., relational adaptation in work and life) are the key resources that people should develop for happier lives and jobs. Other psychological resources for protecting and promoting well-being have been explored recently. For example, Di Fabio and Kenny (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>) has shown that trait of emotional intelligence is associated with higher life satisfaction, above and beyond fluid intelligence and personality traits. In addition, Di Fabio and Palazzeschi (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) have explored the role of resilience (among other variables): they show that resilience is associated with higher life satisfaction above and beyond fluid intelligence and personality trait.</p><p>All the skills mentioned previously draw upon psychological resources, and when developed, could help employees to foster their well-being both in life and at work. This process would complement the powerful role of need satisfaction. Thus, based on previous findings, future perspectives for intervention could focus not only on the satisfaction of the needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness, but also on developing career management and self-management skills, as well as emotional intelligence and resilience. A few programs have emerged recently in Chile for dealing with the promotion of well-being in the workplace. For instance, the Universidad Adolfo Ib&#x000e1;&#x000f1;ez has launched a Graduate Program in Organizational Happiness, the <italic>Diploma en Felicidad Organizacional</italic> (DFO; UAI, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The DFO has become a successful program aimed at training managers and consultants in the business skills and psychological resources needed for promoting well-being both in their lives and in their companies. In addition, the Chilean Ministry of Labor has developed an instrument for measuring mental health risks in the work place, called <italic>Protocolo de Vigilancia de Riesgos Psico-sociales</italic> (MINSAL, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Depending on the companies' results with regard to employees' mental health, companies could be forced by law to implement programs to protect their employees' happiness.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations and future research</title><p>We should acknowledge some limitations in our research.</p><p>First, all our measures are self-reported, which increases the risk of common-method bias. However, self-report measures are justifiable when studying constructs that are self-referential, such as job satisfaction, life satisfaction and need satisfaction (Van den Broeck et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In addition, we put in place several a priori controls (Podsakoff et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Conway and Lance, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) in order to mitigate common-method bias: protecting respondent anonymity, explaining that there would be no right or wrong answers, and allowing participation at the location of the respondents' choice (home, office, etc.). Nonetheless, future research could consider using an additional source of data, such as asking &#x0201c;significant others&#x0201d; to triangulate information, although previous research (Heller et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) has shown that self-report measures of job satisfaction and life satisfaction do not differ significantly from measures collected from &#x0201c;significant others,&#x0201d; which gives support to the use of self-reported information in our three studies.</p><p>Second, following our first concern, the use of self-reported data may be problematic due to shared method variance. However, in our longitudinal analyses, we modeled stability paths from all T1 to all T2 measures. This procedure helps to avoid the possibility that shared method variance might inflate the cross-lagged paths across time. Third, given that the great majority of our participants were all university graduates, we should be cautious about generalizing these findings to poorer and less educated groups. Fourth, and finally, despite the strong evidence showing that job satisfaction is a temporal antecedent of life satisfaction and vice versa&#x02014;and that need satisfaction explains this link, our longitudinal design still does not rule out the possibility of a third, different, unmeasured variable that influences both constructs.</p><p>Importantly, despite the previous limitations, our results considerably strengthen the case not only for a causal path from job satisfaction to life satisfaction, but also for the confounding role of basic need satisfaction in the link mentioned. We presented the first research to date in a Latin American context, showing that job satisfaction and life satisfaction are reciprocally, positively and prospectively linked to each other, but that the link may be spurious due to the important role played by need satisfaction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author contributions</title><p>All authors listed have made substantial, direct and intellectual contribution to the work.
