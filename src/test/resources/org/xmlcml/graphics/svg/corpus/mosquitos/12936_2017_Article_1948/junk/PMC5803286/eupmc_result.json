    "Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in patients with a BMI between 30 and 35 kg/m2 plus comorbidities has shown to be safe and effective. The purpose of this study is to describe our outcomes in this group of patients after 3 years of follow-up.Retrospective descriptive analysis of patients with initial BMI between 30 and 35 kg/m2 plus comorbidities were submitted to LSG between 2006 and 2013. We analyzed gender, age, comorbidities, BMI, total weight loss (%TWL), excess weight loss (%EWL), comorbidity resolution, morbidity, and mortality. Postoperative success was defined as %TWL over 20% and EWL% over 50% maintained for at least 1 year and comorbidity remission with no need of medication.Of the patients, 477 underwent a LSG in the above period and 252 met inclusion criteria; 188 (75%) were female and 64 (25%) were male. Median age was 39 years (15-70). Three-year follow-up was 43.9% (111 patients). Median preoperative BMI was 32.3 kg/m2 (30-34.3). Median postoperative %TWL was 12.9, 23.2, 28.2, 24.3, and 22.1% at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. %EWL was 42.88, 77.44, 98.42, 83.2, and 75.8%. Median surgical time was 86.9 min (40-120). There was comorbidity remission at 36 months. Insulin resistance was remitted in 89.4%, dyslipidemia 52%, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 84.6%, hypertension 75%, and GERD 65%. T2DM had 60% of complete remission and 40% improvement. There were morbidity in six patients (2.4%), two reoperations, no leaks, and no mortality.Performing LSG in patients with grade I obesity is safe and effective. BMI should not be the only indicator to consider bariatric and metabolic surgery. We still require further studies and longer follow-up."
