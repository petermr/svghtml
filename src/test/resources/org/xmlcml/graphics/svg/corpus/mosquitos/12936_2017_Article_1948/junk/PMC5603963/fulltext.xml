In our study, we evaluated the physiological resistance of Prosopis (mesquite) seedlings from different collection sites in the Atacama Desert, northern Chile. Our results show that seedlings of the most hyperarid habitats had the highest tolerance to water stress, as compared to seed collected from less arid sites. These findings are useful for increasing knowledge of the endogenous ecophysiological behaviour of Prosopis spp., which will be instrumental to elaborate upon well-planned forestation plans directed at regenerating and preserving these endangered woodlands.</p></abstract><abstract><title>Abstract</title><p>Initiatives to restore natural ecosystems have had little success in arid and hyperarid ecosystems. In this context, the natural seedling establishment is particularly affected by drought patterns and climatic variability. Likewise, the effect of plant provenance on forest restoration success remains unclear, although previous studies have concluded that some seed locations might be better able to tolerate water stress. In this study, we examined the physiological mechanisms involved in the drought stress resistance of <italic>Prosopis tamarugo</italic> and <italic>Prosopis alba</italic> seedlings from different arid and hyperarid locations of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. We measured the xylem water potential (&#x003a8;), cuticular transpiration (E<sub>c</sub>), specific leaf area (SLA) and pressure&#x02013;volume curves at the intrapopulation and interpopulation levels of seedlings of both species subjected to three drought-induced treatments. In addition, plant characteristics such as seedling height (Sh), stem diameter (Sd), leaf biomass (Lb), root biomass (Rb) and seedling survival (Ss) were measured during the treatments. Seedlings of most hyperarid habitats had the highest values of &#x003a8; and water content relative to the turgor loss point, as well as decreased SLA, especially during the strongest drought treatment. &#x003a8; was strongly correlated with Sh in both species, and soil humidity was correlated with Sd. This study highlights the high variability of physiological responses to water stress in both species at the interpopulation and intrapopulation levels, which provides us with a powerful seed selection tool for future reforestation programmes aimed at the early selection and genetic improvement of species of the <italic>Prosopis</italic> genus.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Atacama Desert</kwd><kwd>drought stress</kwd><kwd><italic>Prosopis</italic></kwd><kwd>reforestation</kwd><kwd>seedling provenances</kwd><kwd>water relations</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In general, drought stress in plants has been identified as a major limiting factor of growth and yield in arid and semiarid ecosystems. Water stress caused by summer drought is the main factor limiting the establishment of this species (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Villagra <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Physiologically, these limitations involve not only stomatal closure but also a decrease in stem water potentials (&#x003a8;) and lower rates of carbon assimilation (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Delatorre <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). Moreover, some species prone to water stress during periods of greater water availability tend not to control water loss to the same degree and hence are termed &#x02018;water-spender species&#x02019; because they preserve water during dry periods but not during wet ones (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Levitt 1980</xref>). Conversely, other species tolerate drought stress based on a &#x02018;water conservative strategy&#x02019; by avoiding water loss during dry and wet periods adjusting cuticular transpiration (E<sub>c</sub>) and stomatal closure (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Villar-Salvador <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). However, several authors agree that the main physiological drought adaptation strategy of arid climate plants seems to be the need to maintain a high water content and cell turgor, which might have a direct effect on their subsequent growth and seed production processes (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Villalobos and Pel&#x000e1;ez 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, not all plants have the same strategies to respond to periods of water stress. For example, greater reductions in the growth of some species facing water limitations, such as <italic>Prosopis alpataco</italic> and <italic>Prosopis argentina</italic>, are affected in a negative way; however, their specific leaf areas (SLAs) are not significantly affected (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Villagra and Cavagnaro 2006</xref>). On the other hand, under these same water limitations, the SLA of <italic>Erythrina velutina</italic> individuals&#x02014;a member of the Fabaceae that can tolerate water stress&#x02014;is significantly affected after long periods of drought stress (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Da Silva <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).</p><p>
<italic>Prosopis</italic> species are widely distributed in natural ecosystems in Africa, America and Asia and have important economic value due to their use as a source of food, seeds and agroforestry (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Giordano <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). In the Atacama Desert in northern Chile, individuals of the endangered phreatophyte tamarugo tree (<italic>Prosopis tamarugo</italic>)&#x02014;endemic to the Tarapac&#x000e1; region&#x02014;are widely distributed in these arid lands, and, along with white mesquite (<italic>Prosopis alba</italic>) and Chilean mesquite (<italic>Prosopis chilensis</italic>), they are the most common phreatophyte species in the natural ecosystem known as &#x02018;Pampa del Tamarugal&#x02019;, which is considered an agroforestry system (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Ormaz&#x000e1;bal 1991</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Chiappa <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>). Unlike <italic>P. tamarugo</italic>, <italic>P. alba</italic> forests are distributed in ecosystems of Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Peru, and this species is classified as a vulnerable tree in Chile (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Benoit 1989</xref>).</p><p>One of the main obstacles to the success of reforestation programmes in the Pampa del Tamarugal aquifer relates to the water table, which has shown a decline in the past few decades. This trend is associated with both the mining industry and the use of water by the urban population. The water flux into the aquifer is calculated to be between 880 and 1000 L s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, while the water outflow is estimated to be as high as 4000 L s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Calderon <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). Another global challenge of the <italic>Prosopis</italic> agroecosystem is its poor performance in natural regeneration compared with other desert species, due mainly to the endozoochory mechanism, since the rainfall is close to 0.6 mm year<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Zelada 1986</xref>). In this context, there is no general consensus that explains the low natural regeneration rates of individuals of the <italic>Prosopis</italic> genus. Previous studies have concluded that the regeneration rates are extremely low mainly due to periods in which the El ni&#x000f1;o phenomenon occurs, which induces erratic behaviour in the natural germination of seeds (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). However, other factors that could affect the regeneration rates relate to the ecological system, such as the pressure of predation from herbivores, the competition with grasses associated with agroforestry ecosystems of <italic>Prosopis</italic> or the water stress that constantly affects the ecosystem (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Bush and Van Auken 1991</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Weltzin <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Shackleton <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>).</p><p>Initiatives to restore natural ecosystems using mesquite (<italic>Prosopis</italic>) species have had little success in northern Chile ecosystems (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Altamirano 2006</xref>). The effect of plant provenance on forest restoration success remains unclear, although previous studies have concluded that some seed locations&#x02014;from the natural dispersal centre of origin&#x02014;might be better able to tolerate water stress (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Cony 1995</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Cariaga <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Thus, there is a need to increase the knowledge of the physiological strategy that seedlings from different locations of species from this genus utilize during periods of drought because an intrinsic feature of <italic>Prosopis</italic> is the high genetic variability of its populations, which might produce different responses to the same type of stress (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Cony and Trione 1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Carevic <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). These parameters are especially interesting because they can be used in reforestation plans when selecting seeds. Additionally, under natural conditions, <italic>Prosopis</italic> individuals are often exposed to periods of low temperature and frost during winter. Studies of water relations in <italic>Prosopis</italic> species of the arid zones of Chile are still emerging, and the physiological mechanism of the adaptation of seedlings to drought remains unclear (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Altamirano 2006</xref>). A better understanding of the strategies used by different <italic>Prosopis</italic> plants for drought tolerance would help to develop comprehensive models of plant water requirements in arid zones and other drought-prone regions. These responses allow the species to survive and even to maintain some growth under adverse conditions, considering that the plant response depends on the nature of the water shortage that induces physiological responses to short-term changes. The goal of this study was to understand the mechanisms involved in drought stress resistance of <italic>P. tamarugo</italic> and <italic>P. alba</italic> seedlings from different locations. We hypothesized that both species will show different adaptive strategies in relation to their drought resistance and provenance. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the provenances of <italic>P. tamarugo</italic> and <italic>P. alba</italic> in the most driest region (Tarapac&#x000e1;) would be the most tolerant to drought because this zone is the area of the natural dispersion of this species. These findings will provide a theoretical basis for the ecological protection and restoration of the Pampa del Tamarugal basin and the surrounding arid region.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study site</title><p>This research was carried out by collecting seeds of <italic>P. tamarugo</italic> and <italic>P. alba</italic> from nine random natural distribution zones of the Atacama Desert (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

The leaves were then placed into plastic bags, taken to the laboratory inside portable coolers, placed in the dark and refrigerated, and then measured immediately.</p><p>To measure E<sub>c</sub>, two healthy and fully grown leaves were selected from the same individuals and on the same sampling dates as the water potential measurements. After the leaves were selected, they were taken to the laboratory in a cooler inside glass tubes with the base of the short petiole submerged in water and were left in complete darkness for 24 h at 4 &#x000b0;C to be completely hydrated. Before performing the measurements, the leaves remaining inside the tubes were placed in an illuminated area of the laboratory to facilitate stomatal opening and temperature equilibration (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Cape and Percy 1996</xref>). Cuticular transpiration was estimated using the free transpiration method (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Quisenberry <italic>et al.</italic> 1982</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Carevic <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). For this purpose, the leaves were placed on a plastic grille at 5 cm above the laboratory table. Next, their fresh weight was measured on a scale (&#x000b1;0.1 mg) at 5-, 10-, and 30-min intervals for ~7 h. These data were used to create transpiration decline curves for each leaf. The relative water content at the point of stomatal closure (RWC<sub>c</sub>) and cuticular transpiration (E<sub>c</sub>, &#x000b5;mol H<sub>2</sub>O kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were deduced from these curves. Then, after being placed in a heater at 65 &#x000b0;C until constant weight was reached, the surface area and dry weight were determined. The SLA (m<sup>2</sup> kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was also calculated for each leaf.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Pressure&#x02013;volume curves</title><p>To create <italic>pressure</italic>&#x02013;<italic>volume</italic> curves, a total of two twigs were taken from the same individuals as those used for &#x003a8; and E<sub>c</sub>. These twigs were selected from the seedlings and kept in a refrigerated chamber (3 &#x000b0;C) in darkness. The base of the twig was submerged in distilled water, and the twigs were covered with a polyethylene bag for at least 24 h to facilitate hydration until saturation occurred (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Larcher 2003</xref>). Data collection was carried out using the free transpiration method (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Robichaux 1984</xref>), which consists of measuring the &#x003a8; and fresh weight (FW) of the twig over short periods of time and at a constant temperature of 25 &#x000b0;C (&#x000b1;2 &#x000b0;C) until dehydration occurs. Afterwards, the twigs were placed in an oven at 70 &#x000b0;C to obtain their dry weight (DW) and relative water content (RWC = 100[FW &#x02212; DW]/[FW<sub>sat</sub> &#x02212; DW]), where FW<sub>sat</sub> is the fresh weight after water saturation. Once the <italic>pressure</italic>&#x02013;<italic>volume</italic> curves were represented in a graph and it was established that there were no oversaturation points, the components of &#x003a8; (osmotic component and turgor or pressure component) could be determined for any hydration status.

These physiological characteristics could explain the prevalence of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>alba</italic> in more mesic habitats found in the arid to semiarid ecosystems of South America. These results are in accordance with those of other studies which reported stronger effects of decreased water supply on the morphological and physiological parameters of mesic <italic>P</italic>. <italic>alba</italic> than those of other xeric species (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Vilela <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Vilela <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). In terms of provenance, the clear differences obtained for parameters &#x003a8; and SLA showed that the seeds which had originated north of the collection areas included in the present study were well adapted to drought. Thus, the tendency of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>tamarugo</italic> (originating in Tarapac&#x000e1;) to maintain high &#x003a8; and RWC<sub>0</sub> values during T3 (&#x02212;2.4 MPa and 90 %, respectively) clearly indicates the presence of an adjustment strategy to withstand stress periods. These results from Tarapac&#x000e1; may be associated with the fact that this distribution area is the natural dispersal centre for this species (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Calderon <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>), which may have conferred critical ontogenic features to this species in order to adapt to the stress encountered in the Pampa del Tamarugal plain. Other studies which focussed on drought-tolerant species support the idea that seeds originating in natural dispersal areas for the species have genetic and morphological features that positively affect adaptation to the most severe environmental stresses typical of their place of origin (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Cony 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000e1;nchez-Vila and Retuerto 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Andivia <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>).</p><p>SLA is a parameter that varies depending on the water stress conditions that affect leaf growth, location of the crown (in terms of light) or nutrient availability (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Mousseau 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Larcher 2003</xref>). In the present study, the origin location values of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>tamarugo</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>alba</italic> showed significant differences; these differences mainly appeared during the most severe drought treatments, with evidently higher values in the most humid locations (Antofagasta). This strategy may have been linked to a higher accumulation of non-structural leaf biomass in the driest locations (Tarapac&#x000e1;) as a response to reduce excessive water loss through the epidermis, which would allow the plants at this location to maintain higher RWC<sub>0</sub> values (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Larcher 2003</xref>). This is a typical strategy of drought-tolerant species and can be used as an effective indicator of the degree of tolerance among species or their offspring. Similarly, in the same study area, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Carevic <italic>et al.</italic> (2015)</xref> found that increase in leaf biomass is associated with SLA in mesquite (<italic>Prosopis burkartii</italic>) during stress periods caused by frost, which indicates the sensitivity of this parameter to the presence of environmental stress.</p><p>Conversely, RWC<sub>0</sub> has been identified as an important indicator of the water status of leaves under drought conditions (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Koide <italic>et al.</italic> 1989</xref>). RWC<sub>0</sub> is strictly related to cell volume, and thus, it reflects the balance among the water content, water supply to the leaf and transpiration rate more accurately (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Andivia <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). In the present study, the trends clearly indicated a water conservation strategy during the highest drought period, with maximum values close to 90 % in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>tamarugo</italic>. This strategy better outlines the way in which this species resists drought, which involves retaining a high percentage of water within its leaf tissues before stomatal closure. In <italic>P</italic>. <italic>alba</italic>, drought strategies were mostly reflected by higher accumulation of biomass at the moment of T3 application (indicated by decreased SLA values) and by maintenance of higher water potentials compared with others in more humid locations (Toconao and Chiu Chiu). In contrast, in the semiarid ecosystems of Argentina and under saline stress, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>alba</italic> utilizes strategies that are mainly associated with the suppression of its photosynthetic apparatus rather than those associated with water variables. This is because when faced with such a stress, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>alba</italic> possesses the ability to decrease its net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance at the expense of its &#x003a8;, which decreases as stress becomes more severe (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Meloni 2014</xref>). In contrast, when we compared &#x003a8; of both the species during the most severe drought treatment, we observed that the extreme minimum values obtained in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>alba</italic> reached values close to &#x02212;3.0 MPa, whereas <italic>P</italic>. <italic>tamarugo</italic> maintained extreme values of &#x02212;2.4 MPa during T3. This fact is directly linked to the most efficient stomatal closure and lower E<sub>c</sub> rate under minimal &#x003a8; values, which was indicated by the positive relationship between &#x003a8; and E<sub>c</sub> in both species.</p><p>It is important to note that the relationships observed between plant height of both species and &#x003a8; afford this parameter a significant influence that inhibits growth during the first months of seedling growth. Thus, maintaining values close to &#x02212;1.0 MPa benefitted growth even more when seedlings of both species with values close to &#x02212;3.0 MPa had a lower height. Similar trends were described by <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Vilela <italic>et al.</italic> (1996)</xref> in <italic>Prosopis</italic> spp. with regard to different watering rates, which directly affected the height and stem growth diameters of seedlings. The high variability of physiological response to water stress reported in the present study provides us with a powerful seed selection tool for species that are currently classified as endangered (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>tamarugo</italic>) and vulnerable (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>alba</italic>) by Chilean environmental agencies (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Carevic <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). All of these responses, detectable at an age as early as 1 or 2 years, have an advantage that allows their use in reforestation and preservation programmes and represent an important source of information for future programmes aimed at early selection and genetic improvement of <italic>Prosopis</italic> spp.</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this research, we analysed the effects of different drought treatments on seedlings of two phreatophyte <italic>Prosopis</italic> spp. which grow in hyperarid climate. In general, &#x003a8;, SLA and RWC<sub>0</sub> underwent rapid change under drought stress. These results indicate that in <italic>Prosopis</italic> spp. individuals, these physiological variables can be used as sensitive indicators for measuring drought stress and are good tools for investigating differences in physiological behaviour under different water supply periods. In addition, these results are useful for increasing the knowledge of the endogenous ecophysiological behaviour of <italic>Prosopis</italic> spp., which will be instrumental to elaborate upon well-planned forestation plans directed to regenerate and preserve these endangered woodlands. Nevertheless, further studies are required to elucidate the genetic mechanism of drought tolerance differences at interpopulation and intrapopulation levels in <italic>Prosopis</italic> spp. Thus, this intriguing and controversial topic warrants focus in future studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Sources of Funding</title><p>The authors acknowledge the financial support of FONDECYT project number 11130242 and CONAF project number 047/2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Contributions by the Authors</title><p>F.S.C. conceived the idea, performed the physiological measures and wrote the article; J.D.H. performed the statistical analyses; J.D.C. analysed the data and revised the article.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>None declared.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the staff of National Forest Corporation (CONAF) at Pampa del Tamarugal National Reserve.</p></ack><ref-list><title>Literature Cited</title><ref id="CIT0001"><mixed-citation publication-type="book">
