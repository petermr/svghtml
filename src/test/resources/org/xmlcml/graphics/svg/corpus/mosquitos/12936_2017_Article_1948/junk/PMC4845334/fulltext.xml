Calcium enters through CNG gates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels, allowing a Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> inward current that enhances the depolarization initiated by the CNG-dependent inward current.

Odorants bind to G-protein coupled receptors, which activate adenylyl cyclase type III by coupling to a heterotrimeric G-protein (Golf), producing cyclic-AMP. This nucleotide directly opens non-selective cationic cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG) channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions entering the cilia through these channels in turn gate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels (CaCCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], generating a Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> efflux that amplifies the depolarization initiated by the CNG-dependent current [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] (but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]). The CNG channel has been thoroughly characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], but the CaCC channel has been difficult to assess, and has been focus of attention since it was discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and its physiological importance unraveled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Its electrophysiological characterization has been hampered by the extremely small conductances of the reported channels and the miniscule diameter of the olfactory cilia, bordering the limit of resolution of light microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For this reason, only macroscopic current measurements had been performed on OSNs by means of whole cell recording [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], excised entire individual cilium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and patch clamping the dendritic knob [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], an apical round-shape structure of the dendrite from where the olfactory cilia emanate. As the knob has a nearly tenfold larger diameter than a cilium (~2 vs. 0.2&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m), it is more amenable for patch clamping; nevertheless, the measurements obtained from the dendritic knob assume that the same channels of the cilia are also present in the knob. No single Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents have been directly recorded from the ciliary membrane, limiting the biophysical characterization of the olfactory Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> conductance.</p><p>Anoctamin-2 (ANO2), an ion channel belonging to the anoctamin family of CaCCs, has been proposed as the main contributor to the odor-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> conductance, as the Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current is largely absent in the ANO2 knock-out mice. However, field potential recordings from the olfactory epithelium of these mutant mice are only partly reduced and these animals do not exhibit impairment in smell behavioral tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], suggesting that more than one CaCC species might be involved in odor transduction. A second CaCC channel type was found in the olfactory cilia, Best2 from the Bestrophin family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], later considered not to be implicated in odor transduction because its genetic ablation had no influence in smelling behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Both channels possess estimated conductances below 1 pS, too small for resolving unitary currents. Two additional CaCCs, ClCa4l and ClCa2 from the ClCa family, were recently reported in rat olfactory cilia by PCR, western blotting and immunochemical evidence, being ClCa4l much more abundant than ClCa2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; none of these two channels have been characterized electrophysiologically. Direct patch-clamp recordings from the chemosensory cilia of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents at the single-channel level would help to clarify this scenario, but they have not been performed for any of the aforementioned channels.</p><p>Here we explored the ciliary membrane for detectable single-channel currents by recording directly from inside-out membrane patches excised from toad olfactory cilia, taking advantage of their somewhat larger dimensions than those of mammals, and found a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel not previously described. A complementary immunocytochemistry study with anti-ClCa and anti-ANO2 antibodies revealed co-immunoreactivity in the toad cilia, raising the possibility that the novel channel may belongs to the ClCa channel family.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of a ciliary Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel</title><p>A typical dissociated toad olfactory neuron is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a in which the chemosensory cilia are clearly visible.

It is important to point out that because these experiments were extremely hard to do, not only due to the difficulty of obtaining ciliary patches but also because most membrane patches did not last long enough to allow collecting sufficient data to build reasonably complete curves.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel from toad olfactory cilia. <bold>a</bold> Isolated olfactory receptor neuron under DIC optics; s, soma; d, dendrite; k, dendritic knob; c, cilia; p, patch-clamp pipette. <bold>b</bold> Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents from an inside-out excised ciliary patch at different Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (V<sub>m</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02212;30&#x000a0;mV, V<sub>bath</sub>&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;V<sub>pipette</sub>); whole-point amplitude histograms are shown by each trace. <bold>c</bold> Plot of nPo vs. [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (nPo: number of channels times the open probability; see &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d; section).

Based on the conserved morphological and functional characteristics of the olfactory sensory neurons between amphibians and mammals studied so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and in particular the similarity of their transduction cascades, it is plausible that orthologs of the toad CaCC cilia channels are shared with mammals. Often proteins from evolutionarily distant species cross-react to antibodies developed to one of them; amphibian and mammalian CNG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] of olfactory cilia illustrate this fact. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The channel exhibits a steep sigmoidal dose&#x02013;response relation, revealing a pronounced Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence in a narrow range of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (below 0.5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M) within physiological levels. Notably, although the curve presents a similar shape than those of ANO2 and Best2, it is shifted to lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations; its Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity is considerably higher than these two other channels, as indicated by its K<sub>0.5</sub> of ~0.38&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M, compared to 1.8&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M for ANO2 and 4.7&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M for Best2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Previous estimates from macroscopic current measurements in excised intact frog cilia are within the same range of the two mammalian channels (&#x003b3;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.8 pS, K<sub>0.5</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4.8&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The evidence is consistent with a Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel. This channel also conducts acetate, the anion used to replace Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> in the pipette, as revealed by the ~40&#x000a0;mV reversal potential in the current&#x02013;voltage relations. In agreement to the Goldman, Hodgkin and Katz equation, P<sub>Ac</sub>/P<sub>Cl</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.47, close to previously reported values for CaCCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The channel reported hereby possesses distinct properties compared with the two olfactory CaCCs previously reported in mice, namely ANO2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and Best2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], suggesting that they correspond to a novel type of CaCC channel protein. Because of its relatively large unit conductance (&#x003b3;&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;10 pS), its single-channel currents could be clearly resolved; in contrast, those from the other two channels are below the resolution of patch clamp amplifiers, as their unitary conductances are in the sub-pS range, according to noise analysis estimates (0.8 and 0.26 pS, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]).</p><p>The immunochemical data showing co-expression of ClCa4l and ANO2 in the cilia suggests that the toad CaCC may correspond to an ortholog of ClCa4l, but in the absence of molecular biology evidence this cannot be established. An electrophysiological correlation would have helped to support the presence of the channel reported hereby and ANO2 in the olfactory cilia such as observing the current events of the two different channels in the patches; however, this is not plausible mainly because of the size of the ANO2 unitary currents.</p><p>Why has this channel not been detected in mammals, in spite of its big conductance? Besides the trivial possibility of not being expressed in them, it is plausible that even though its single-channel currents are sufficiently large to be resolved, their overall number in the cilia could be much smaller than that of ANO2; in such a case, the ANO2 currents would dominate, masking the currents of the other channel in the macroscopic measurements.</p><p>Recordings from inside-out ciliary patches revealed transitions with complex kinetics. The data do not allow discriminating whether the recordings emerged from an individual channel with more than one conductance state or from more than one channel in the patches. Further investigation is necessary to elucidate this issue.</p><p>Our immunocytochemical evidence obtained with an anti-ClCa antibody is consistent with the presence in the toad olfactory cilia of an orthologous of the rat ClCa4l [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which may have some role in chemotransduction. It is debated whether or not the CaCl family is comprised of functional ion channels or of accessory proteins that regulate the expression of other CaCCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Further investigation is required to identify the molecular nature of the toad CaCC reported hereby and establish its functional role.</p><p>A channel with the relatively high Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity, strong Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence and comparatively large conductance such as the toad CaCC could play a relevant role in odorant responses. It is reasonable to imagine that as the CNG conductance develops, the membrane potential begins to depolarize and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> level to gradually rise, opening the CaCCs. The first CaCC to open would be that with the highest Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity; the higher its conductance, the bigger would be its impact on the receptor potential. This would be the case for ClCa, which fulfills both characteristics (K<sub>0.5</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.38&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M, &#x003b3;&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;10 pS). The role of this channel could be to boost the receptor potential in its early phase, until Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels reach the threshold for the activation of the lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity more abundant CaCCs, which would then gradually govern the receptor potential by allowing a relatively much larger Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current component.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The reported channel suggests that the electrophysiological tools possessed by the olfactory cilia to carry out chemotransduction may be more complex than previously considered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><p>The aim of this study was to report a novel Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel discovered in olfactory cilia and explore its possible significance and identity, using electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments were conducted on isolated olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) from toad (<italic>Caudiverbera caudiverbera</italic>) olfactory epithelium.

After 3&#x000a0;h they were fixed for 30&#x000a0;min in 4&#x000a0;% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and permeabilized with 0.2&#x000a0;% Triton in PBS at room temperature. Unspecific sites were blocked by incubation in phosphate buffer saline, PBS, containing 0.2&#x000a0;% gelatin-PBS. The cells were then incubated overnight with the primary antibody rabbit anti-human ANO2 (1:100; Sigma, catalog number HPA036276USA) and mouse anti-rat ClCa (1:100; custom made) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] diluted in gelatine-PBS at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in a humidified chamber. After this incubation the cells were washed 6 times with gelatin-PBS for 30&#x000a0;min. Incubation with the secondary antibodies anti-rabbit AlexaFluor-546 and anti-mouse Alexa-488 (1:1000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon, USA) was then performed for 2&#x000a0;h at room temperature in the dark. The cells were washed five times with PBS and once with distilled water for mounting. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Fluoromount (Southern-Biotech, USA). The cells were viewed in an inverted laser confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 510 Meta, Germany, 63x objective).</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANO2</term><def><p>anoctamin 2 channel of the anoctamine family</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Best2</term><def><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel of the bestrophin family</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CaCC</term><def><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ClCa</term><def><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel of the ClCa family</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CNG</term><def><p>cyclic nucleotide-gated channel</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Golf</term><def><p>GTP-binding protein of olfactory cilia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OSN</term><def><p>olfactory sensory neuron</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>RD performed the electrophysiological experiments, performed data analysis and prepared the corresponding figures.
