The option to delay or avoid definitive therapy avoids or minimises patient morbidity without compromising long term outcomes in appropriately selected patients [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to the Prostate Cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial (PIVOT) [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], men with low risk disease defined as a prostate specific antigen (PSA) &#x02264; 10ng/mL, a Gleason score &#x02264; 6, and T stage 1 or 2a had no difference in mortality, i.e., in terms of all-cause mortality and prostate cancer specific mortality. There was als no difference in rate of progression to bone metastasis when assigned to radical prostatectomy or AO. The criteria for AO according to Epstein [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] are a diagnosis of prostate cancer with two or less of the 12 prostate biopsy cores positive for cancer, no single biopsy core with &#x0003e; 50% infiltration, and a PSA density &#x0003c; 0.15ng/mL. Using these criteria to select patients with 'insignificant disease' has a positive predictive value of 95% and a negative predictive value of 66% [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These men are actively followed up with repeat annual biopsies; the timing of intervention after the initial diagnosis is based on variables such as PSA kinetics, Gleason grade progression, patient preference and/or clinical or radiologic evidence of disease progression [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. An increase in the Gleason score at repeat biopsy is predictive of the time to active treatment and correlates with patient outcome [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It has been reported that Gleason score progression occurs in approximately 20% of men, more than 50% of cases occurring within two years of the initial diagnosis [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, a similar increase is seen in men subjected to immediate repeat biopsy when entering an AO programme [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This short time interval in comparison with the long natural history of prostate cancer suggests that sampling error rather than tumour progression is probably the primary source of tumour upgrading in these men. The use of other biomarkers, such as CPCs, could be useful in re-defining these patients who could be more adequately treated by AS.</p><p>Early in prostate cancer there are at least one sub-population of cancer cells that disseminate firstly to the neurovascular structures and then into the circulation [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The majority of these cells are eliminated by host defense mechanisms or destroyed by shear forces as they circulate in the blood and lymph systems [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These cells defined as primary CPCs are not found in small volume low grade cancers [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>We present a prospective study in men who complied with the Epstein criteria for AO but choose to undergo radical prostatectomy. We compared the presence or absence of primary CPCs with the pathological findings of the surgical specimen to determine if men CPC positive were more likely to have 'upgraded cancer'.</p></sec><sec sec-type="patientsandmethods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>A single centre observational study of a cohort of 426 men who underwent radical prostatectomy as the sole treatment for prostate cancer between 2005 and 2012.

These 102 patients formed the study population.</p><p>The 102 men showed a symmetrically age distribution with mean &#x000b1; SD of 66 2&#x000b1; 8.6years. The total serum PSA (median: 5.16; IQR: 2.37), the number of positive biopsy cores (median:1; IQR: 1), median percentage infiltration 5% (IQR: 5%), the Gleason Score of biopsy (median 5; IQR: 1) and Surgical Specimen Gleason Score (median:5; IQR:2) showed asymmetrical distribution. The p-values of the Shapiro-Wilk test were 0.15 or more for age, Gleason Score of first biopsy and Surgical Specimen Gleason Score.</p><p>For the population total, 25 (24.51%; CI95%: 16.16&#x02013;32.86)were disease upgraded based on the results of the surgical specimen. Among them 21 men (20.59%;CI 95%: 12.74&#x02013;28.44) had pathological stage 2b or greater; extra-capsular extension was observed in 17men (16.67%;CI95%: 9.43&#x02013;23.90); a positive surgical margin was present in one patient (0.98;CI 95%: 0&#x02013;2.90).

The use of AO is dependent on developing methods for selecting patients with a high possibility of indolent disease. The use of variations of the Epstein criteria has been suggested along with a validated nomogram to predict indolent cancer. It is defined as a pathologically organ confined cancer with a volume of less than 0.5 mL and no poorly differentiated elements. The nomogram has a discrimination defined as good with an area under of the curve of 0.64&#x02013;0.79 [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The observed association between the presence of CPCs and the pathological findings at surgery of higher Gleason score and higher pathological stage allows us to suggest that primary CPCs are another risk factor for the detection of more advanced prostate cancer. The absence of an association between the detection of primary CPCs and seminal vesicle and lymph node infiltration by cancer could be explained in that these patients have been classified as low risk for advanced cancer. The relative risk of upgrading is five times higher in men CPC positive.</p><p>This observational experience allows us to suggest that the presence of primary CPCs should be considered a risk factor for upgrading in patients considered to have low-risk prostate cancer.</p><p>We recognise that our study population is small, however, that approximately 24% fulfilled the criteria for AO and of these patients approximately 24.51% were upgraded is consistent with the reported data [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. That this upgrading was determined within six months of the initial biopsy supports the concept of sampling error at the initial biopsy which is a well described phenomenon [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>We have previously reported that men with CPC negative prostate cancer had low grade, small volume tumours [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which is supported by these new data. What we consider more important is that the presence of primary CPCs is associated with a high frequency of disease upgrade or upstaging in men who fulfill the criteria for AO. A 40% of men CPC positive were upstaged based on the pathological findings of the surgical specimen. Thus as a pre-treatment biomarker the presence of CPCs suggests that AO may not be the most adequate treatment option. It is important to note that primary CPCs have a limited prognostic value, independent of the method used to detect them [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but that men CPC negative have an excellent ten year biochemical failure free survival of &#x0003e; 90% [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] when treated with radical prostatectomy.</p><p>Serum PSA is the main biochemical marker used for the prognosis and progression of prostate cancer [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], however, 25% of those patients experiencing disease progression while on active observation do not have a rise in PSA levels [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus primary CPC detection may be a better biomarker for selecting patients for AO as currently only 10% of men eligible for AO actually elect this treatment option [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Other biomarkers have been used to assess the risk of upgrading; low serum testosterone has been associated with upgrading, upstaging, unfavourable disease and positive surgical margins [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Lower serum testosterone levels have been associated with high grade prostate cancer and a higher stage at presentation [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Obesity and the metabolic syndrome have been associated with a low serum total testosterone and unfavourable outcome [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the same context, men with a higher body mass index have been reported to have higher rates of upgrading and upstaging [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Of mention what is interesting is that the frequency of primary CPC detection has been reported to increase with increasing body mass index [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>The expression of urotensin II receptor has also been reported to be associated with upgrading [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>The detection of CPCs is highly method dependent and has previously been reviewed [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, the method described does not require high state technology and can be implemented in the routine immunocytochemical laboratory of a general hospital. Limitations of this study include those inherent in its observational design. To reduce this interobsever variation, it is recommended that the same pathologist inform both the biopsy and surgical specimen. A larger study population is still needed to confirm these results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In men fulfilling the criteria for AO but are positive for primary CPC detection, there is a high risk of disease upgrade, thus these men may not be ideal candidates for AO.
