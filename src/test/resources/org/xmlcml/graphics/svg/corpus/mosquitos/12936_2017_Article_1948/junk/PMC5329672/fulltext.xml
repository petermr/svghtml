High muscle glucose disposal after meals is pivotal for adapting to increased glycemia and might drive insulin secretion through muscle-released factors (e.g., myokines). We hypothesized that insulin influences myokine secretion and then increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). In conditioned media from human myotubes incubated with/without insulin (100&#x02009;nmol/L) for 24&#x02009;h, myokines were qualitatively and quantitatively characterized using an antibody-based array and ELISA-based technology, respectively. C57BL6/J mice islets and Wistar rat beta cells were incubated for 24&#x02009;h with control and conditioned media from noninsulin- and insulin-treated myotubes prior to GSIS determination. Conditioned media from insulin-treated versus nontreated myotubes had higher RANTES but lower IL6, IL8, and MCP1 concentration. Qualitative analyses revealed that conditioned media from noninsulin- and insulin-treated myotubes expressed 32 and 23 out of 80 myokines, respectively. Islets incubated with conditioned media from noninsulin-treated myotubes had higher GSIS versus control islets (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Meanwhile, conditioned media from insulin-treated myotubes did not influence GSIS. In beta cells, GSIS was similar across conditions. In conclusion, factors being present in noninsulin-stimulated muscle cell-derived media appear to influence GSIS in mice islets.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002850">Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient&#x000ed;fico y Tecnol&#x000f3;gico</funding-source><award-id>1130217</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>National Research Agency</funding-source><award-id>ANR-12-JSV1-0010-01</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711">Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#x000f6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</funding-source><award-id>31&#x02013;135 645</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Swiss Society for Endocrinology and Diabetes</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>P.

Introduction</title><p>Regulation of insulin secretion is critical for understanding glucose homeostasis under (patho)physiological conditions. Such regulation is particularly complex in the transition from fasting to postprandial state on which its secretion must be tightly adjusted to insulin needs, so tissue glucose supply is assured while hypo- and hyperglycaemia are prevented.</p><p>Skeletal muscle plays an active role controlling circulating glucose concentration. On the one hand, this tissue is a major site of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which is crucial in the adaptation to the rapid increase in glucose flux into circulation after a meal. On the other hand, skeletal muscle might also influence insulin secretion by interacting with pancreas through humoral factors [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Interestingly, two skeletal muscle-specific genetic mice models characterized by altered glucose metabolism (a knock-out for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha [PGC1-alpha<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>] [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and a transgenic for muscle-specific RING-finger 1 protein [Murf1] [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]) present abnormal in vivo insulin secretion. Such findings have been considered to be indicative of a putative endocrine factor mediating a muscle-pancreas crosstalk.</p><p>In humans, support for this hypothesis comes indirectly from in vivo studies aimed at assessing the effect of insulin on its secretion [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These studies found higher glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) following a 4&#x02009;h isoglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp when compared with a 4&#x02009;h saline infusion [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This finding was in line with an in vitro study reporting higher insulin secretion after insulin stimulation [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, most of the in vitro studies have shown that insulin inhibits its own secretion [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, enhanced GSIS after insulin versus saline infusion may have an alternative explanation. We propose that the drastic increase in skeletal muscle glucose disposal after insulin (versus saline) infusion may trigger the release of a humoral factor having influence on insulin secretion [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In this regard, we recently highlighted an inverse, insulin sensitivity-independent association between 24&#x02009;h whole-body carbohydrate oxidative disposal (an indirect marker of skeletal muscle glucose metabolism) and 24&#x02009;h insulin secretion in humans [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Such finding may suggest that glucose disposal, particularly at the level of its oxidation, may drive insulin secretion [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Further support to this hypothesis underlies on the observation that skeletal muscle-specific PGC1-alpha<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> versus wild-type mice had impaired in vivo but normal in vitro (isolated islets) GSIS. This observation suggests that a humoral factor is mediating an in vivo interaction between skeletal muscle and pancreas.</p><p>The notion that a muscle-pancreas crosstalk exists has been fairly accepted [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], although the effect of muscle-released factors including myokines on pancreatic insulin secretion has not been proven in in vivo animal or human models. A reasonable, feasible, and first-step approach to test this hypothesis is to evaluate the effect of conditioned media from insulin- and noninsulin-treated human myotubes on GSIS from isolated pancreatic islets or beta cells. This model was used by Bouzakri et al. [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], who observed increased GSIS in rat and human primary beta cells incubated with conditioned media from nonstimulated human muscle cells.</p><p>We also included the determination of 5 proteins in the conditioned media as candidate mediators. We selected IL6, IL8/CXCL8, MCP1/CCL2, fractalkine/CX3CL1, and RANTES/CCL5, which are known to be released from muscle cells [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Some of them (IL6, fractalkine/CX3CL1, and RANTES/CCL5) have been also shown to influence in vitro insulin secretion [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In turn, we recently reported that circulating IL8/CXCL8 concentration directly associates with in vivo insulin secretion in humans [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>We found that human myotubes-derived media increased GSIS in isolated mice islets, whereas such effect was not observed in rat primary beta cells. In turn, conditioned media of insulin-treated myotubes did not change GSIS, both in isolated pancreatic islets and beta cells, when compared with control condition. Previously, Bouzakri et al. [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] detected increased GSIS in primary human and rat beta cells incubated with conditioned media from human myotubes. Those findings are consistent with our observation in isolated islets; however, we did not confirm that observation using primary rat beta cells. Eventually, different incubation times between studies (24&#x02009;h in the present study versus 48&#x02009;h) play a role. Alternatively, a potential interaction between beta and nonbeta cells may underlie the contrasting outcome between islets and beta cells. In this regard, Ellingsgaard et al. reported that IL6 enhanced GSIS in islets through increased alpha cell GLP1 secretion [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Our hypothesis that skeletal muscle interacts with pancreas regulating insulin secretion is mostly grounded on the classical inverse association between insulin sensitivity and its secretion [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Several factors found in conditioned media from muscle cells, including proteins (i.e., myokines), metabolites (e.g., lactate), and also vesicular-like structures (e.g., exosomes) [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], may mediate such putative muscle-pancreas crosstalk. Here, we focused on the presence of myokines in conditioned media.</p><p>Human myotubes conditioned media expressed 32 out of 80 detectable proteins. Apparently, none of the most highly expressed myokines (GRO/CXCL1, 2, and 3, MCP1/CCL2, IL8/CXCL8, TIMP1, TIMP2, NAP2/CXCL7, and ENA-78/CXCL5) according to our qualitative approach seemed to play a role in insulin secretion, considering that their receptors in isolated pancreatic islets showed undetectable mRNA expression under cultured conditions (i.e., RPMI 1640 at 11.2&#x02009;mmol/l glucose). Certainly, alternative myokines as well as nonprotein factors may underlie our finding.</p><p>In this regard, a nonprotein factor representing a new cell-to-cell communication mode comes from exosomes. These are microvesicles carrying molecules such as microRNA that can reach distant organs and exert a (patho)physiological effect. Indeed, a recent study showed that skeletal muscle cells-derived exosomes when injected to mice targeted beta cells [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Additional interest was focused on the role of insulin on myokine secretion and then the effect of conditioned media from insulin-treated myotubes on GSIS. As observed for other conditions (e.g., muscle contraction-induced glycogen depletion increases muscle IL6 secretion [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]), the secretion of some myokines might be sensitive to changes in insulin-dependent muscle glucose metabolism. By using a widely accepted in vitro insulin concentration (100&#x02009;nmol/l) to induce muscle cell glucose metabolism [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we found differences in three of the studied proteins expression in conditioned media from noninsulin- versus insulin-treated myotubes (IL6, IL8/CXCL8, and RANTES/CCL5).</p><p>Thus, we observed that an increase in glycogen synthesis/content was accompanied by reduced IL6 concentration in conditioned media of insulin-treated human myotubes. Eventually, IL6 and additional myokines may mediate the well-known inverse association between insulin sensitivity and its secretion [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, such distinct myokine pattern apparently did not lead to differential GSIS from isolated pancreatic or beta cells incubated with media from insulin-treated versus control myotubes.</p><p>In part, insulin induced only minor changes in myokine secretion and GSIS from islets incubated with nonconditioned media and conditioned media from insulin-treated myotubes was similar. It cannot be ruled out that 24&#x02009;h insulin exposure (100&#x02009;nmol/L) may have impaired muscle cell insulin sensitivity and altered any insulin-dependent difference in the pattern of myokine secretion. Thus, some factors might be mostly released during the period of preserved insulin sensitivity, and then their release will be altered as insulin resistance develops. Even so, those factors should still be found in the media independent of the change over time in their secretion pattern. It is also possible that the myokine concentration at which islets were exposed may have been insufficient to influence GSIS. Furthermore, our model based on different species (human myotube-conditioned media and murine islets/beta cells) may add complexity to interpretation. Still, an earlier study found comparable results when rat and human beta cells were treated with conditioned media from human myotubes [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Finally, our in vitro model might not successfully emulate in vivo conditions on which insulin (directly or indirectly) appears to stimulate insulin secretion [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although such effect has been considered to be in line with in vitro evidence indicating that insulin directly enhances its own secretion [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], it must be considered that most in vitro studies found that insulin inhibits its secretion [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, an alternative explanation based on humoral factors coming from insulin-sensitive tissues including skeletal muscle becomes appealing.</p><p>Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that skeletal muscle-released factors can influence insulin secretion, which encourages the quest for identifying the nature of such factor as well as its potential in vivo role on glucose homeostasis. Any eventual physiological relevance of our findings appears independent of insulin and its action in muscle, at least under the context of our study. Thus, a mechanism mediating the interaction between insulin sensitivity and its secretion remains uncovered.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="supplementary-material-sec"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="f1"><caption><p>The myokines identified in those media are listed in Table S1.</p><p>The myokines present in human myotube-derived conditioned media were assessed using an antibody-based array able to detect 80 proteins (Figure S1).</p></caption><media xlink:href="1328573.f1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e765" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by FONDECYT 1130217 (to Jose E.
