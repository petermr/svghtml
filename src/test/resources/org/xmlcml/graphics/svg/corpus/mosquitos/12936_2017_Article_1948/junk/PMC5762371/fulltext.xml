Yet, CAV1 also functions as a tumor suppressor in early stages of cancer, where expression is suppressed by epigenetic mechanisms. Thus, we sought to identify stimuli/mechanisms that revert epigenetic CAV1 silencing in cancer cells and evaluate how this affects their metastatic potential. We reasoned that restricted tissue availability of anti-neoplastic drugs during chemotherapy might expose cancer cells to sub-therapeutic concentrations, which activate signaling pathways and the expression of CAV1 to favor the acquisition of more aggressive traits. Here, we used <italic>in vitro</italic> [2D, invasion] and <italic>in vivo</italic> (metastasis) assays, as well as genetic and biochemical approaches to address this question. Colon and breast cancer cells were identified where CAV1 levels were low due to epigenetic suppression and could be reverted by treatment with the methyltransferase inhibitor 5&#x02019;-azacytidine. Exposure of these cells to anti-neoplastic drugs for short periods of time (24-48 h) increased CAV1 expression through ROS production and MEK/ERK activation. In colon cancer cells, increased CAV1 expression enhanced migration and invasion <italic>in vitro</italic> via pathways requiring Src-family kinases, as well as Rac-1 activity. Finally, elevated CAV1 expression in colon cancer cells following exposure <italic>in vitro</italic> to sub-cytotoxic drug concentrations increased their metastatic potential <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore exposure of cancer cells to anti-neoplastic drugs at non-lethal drug concentrations induces signaling events and changes in transcription that favor CAV1-dependent migration, invasion and metastasis. Importantly, this may occur in the absence of selection for drug-resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>caveolin-1</kwd><kwd>epigenetic silencing</kwd><kwd>chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>cell signaling</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Caveolin-1 (CAV1) is an integral membrane protein that plays a dual role in tumor progression [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. On the one hand, CAV1 protein and mRNA levels are decreased in transformed fibroblasts and in breast and colon cancer cell lines. Also, CAV1 reduction in normal cells promotes cell transformation [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, levels of CAV1 are reduced in several human tumors and, in these cells, CAV1 re-expression is often sufficient to block functions associated with the transformed cell phenotype [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Available evidence indicates that CAV1 down-regulation, observed upon cell transformation, is due to CAV1 gene silencing by methylation of CG nucleotide enriched sequences (CpG islands) present in the <italic>caveolin-1</italic> promoter region. These CpG islands are not methylated in normal breast epithelial cells that express higher levels of CAV1; however in breast cancer cell lines that do not express CAV1, this region is highly methylated [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Alternatively, at later stages of cancer, CAV1 re-expression in lung adenocarcinoma, promotes filopodia formation and increases cell migration, as well as metastatic potential [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In breast cancer cell lines and melanomas, CAV1 expression favors focal adhesion turnover, cell migration and metastasis [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The increased levels of CAV1 have been associated with multidrug resistance (MDR) [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In HT29 colon cancer cells, resistance to the anti-neoplastic drug Methotrexate correlates with higher levels of CAV1 in comparison to untreated cells [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and silencing of CAV1 expression by RNA interference decreases the MDR phenotype and sensitizes cells to Methotrexate treatment [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, given the existing connection between elevated CAV1 expression and drug resistance, and the fact that different stress situations are known to augment CAV1 expression, we hypothesized that treatment with anti-neoplastic drugs at sub-cytotoxic doses may suffice to increase CAV1 levels in cancer cells where the <italic>caveolin-1</italic> gene was silenced epigenetically.</p><p>Cancer cells are known to possess higher levels of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) than healthy cells, due to the decreased oxygen levels or hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment, enhanced cellular metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased growth factor receptor-mediated signaling and oncogene activity [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For this reason, one of the frequently employed strategies to kill cancer cells is by treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs that increase ROS levels beyond the adaptive threshold, which is lower in tumor cells than normal cells, thus triggering apoptosis [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, the induction of ROS production by these chemotherapeutic agents can also activate proliferative and pro-survival signaling pathways, involving ERK1/2 and AKT. Activation of these pathways may favor the development of malignant characteristics, including increased cell migration associated with an elevated metastatic potential in cancer cells [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Metastasis involves several steps, including degradation of the extracellular matrix, stromal invasion, intravasation to blood vessels, extravasation, migration and proliferation in other tissues and organs [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] CAV1 interacts with proteins required for cell migration, such as &#x003b2;1 integrin [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and filamin, promoting lamellipodia formation [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and migration of fibroblasts in a RhoA-dependent fashion [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Alternatively, CAV1 promotes migration of metastatic breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), colon cancer (HT29(US)) and melanoma (B16F10, A375M) cells via activation of the Rab5-Rac1 signaling axis [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Increased CAV1 expression and particularly its phosphorylation on Y14 by Src family kinases are essential to enhance cell migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Importantly, in metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells, CAV1 is highly phosphorylated on Y14 in comparison with non-metastatic cancer cells [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and in B16F10 melanoma cells CAV1 expression promotes matrix-specific migration, invasion and trans-endothelial migration in a Y14-dependent manner [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Given these attributes of CAV1, we evaluated the possibility that acute treatments of cancer cells with anti-neoplastic drugs could increase CAV1 expression. We also determined the signaling pathways involved in this up-regulation and the functional consequences of CAV1 re-expression in cancer cells were assessed using both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches. A DNA methylation inhibitor restored subdued basal CAV1 expression in colon and breast cancer cells. Additionally, Methotrexate and Etoposide decreased promoter region methylation, as well as increased CAV1 mRNA and protein levels in a MEK/ERK and ROS-dependent manner. Importantly, elevated CAV1 levels observed following drug exposure were associated with increased presence of tumor cells in ascites and metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, down-regulation of CAV1 using specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs sufficed to reverse these drug-induced effects, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Taken together, these results implicate acutely enhanced CAV1 expression following the treatment with anti-neoplastic drugs at sub-cytotoxic concentrations in promoting the acquisition of malignant traits associated with a more aggressive cancer cell phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>CAV1 expression is suppressed by methylation rather than histone acetylation in colon and breast cancer cell lines</title><p>The 5&#x02019; region of the <italic>caveolin-1</italic> promoter is enriched in CpG islands that are methylated in breast, lung, ovarian and colon cancer cell lines [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We have previously shown in colon cancer cell lines that increased CAV1 expression arises in conjunction with the development of drug-resistance [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. At least, two potential hypotheses may be entertained to explain these observations. One is that exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs selects for cells that are drug-resistant and that these express higher CAV1 levels. Alternatively, the drugs might directly induce CAV1 expression by mechanisms that remain to be determined and expression of CAV1 in this context would favor the development of a more malignant phenotype. To distinguish between these possibilities, we first evaluated whether the low levels of basal CAV1 expression observed in the colon cancer cells (HT29(US), DLD-1 and HT9(ATCC)) and in the breast cancer cell line MCF7 were attributable to promoter methylation. Treatment of these cells with 5-aza dideoxycytidine (Deoxy, 5 &#x003bc;M), a DNA methylation inhibitor, increased CAV1 expression both in colon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;1C</xref>) and breast cancer cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Conversely, treatment with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, Trichostatin (50 ng/ml), did not significantly increase CAV1 expression and appeared to block the increase due to Deoxy instead (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These observations indicate that basal expression of CAV1 is suppressed both in colon and breast cancer cells by DNA methylation rather than histone deacetylation.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>CAV1 expression is suppressed by DNA methylation in cancer cell lines</title><p>Colon cancer cells <bold>(A)</bold> HT29(US), <bold>(B)</bold> DLD-1 and <bold>(C)</bold> HT29(ATCC) and breast cancer cells <bold>(D)</bold> MCF-7 were treated either with 5-aza dideoxycytidine (Deoxy, 1, 2.5, 5 or 10 &#x003bc;M) for 72 h, Trichostatin (TSA, 50 ng/ml) for 24 h or the combination of 2.5 &#x003bc;M Deoxy and 25 ng/ml TSA.

These observations, together with others showing that CAV1 expression is frequently up-regulated in response to stress situations [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], caught our attention. Given this CAV1 connection to a more aggressive phenotype at later stages of cancer disease, we reasoned that treatment with cytotoxic drugs using conditions that may not induce cell death might in fact promote CAV1 expression and thereby favor cancer progression. With this in mind, we treated colon and breast cancer cell lines with different chemotherapeutic agents that are routinely employed in cancer therapy, namely Methotrexate, Etoposide, Doxorubicin, Staurosporine, Taxol and Cisplatin. Note that for all the drugs employed, with the exception of Doxorubicin, cell viability was around 50-90% at the end of the treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We next evaluated CAV1 protein expression in the cancer cells. Subsequently, optimal conditions for CAV1 expression were defined by treating HT29(US) cells either with increasing concentrations for a specific period of time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>) or a given concentration for varying periods of time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). All the anti-neoplastic drugs employed, increased CAV1 expression in the colon cancer cell line HT29(US), but the effect was stronger with the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor Methotrexate, and the topoisomerase II inhibitor Etoposide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). In the case of DLD-1 cells, Methotrexate and Etoposide were the only two drugs that significantly increased CAV1 protein levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). This was also the case for the breast cancer cell line MCF7 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), while for HT29(ATCC) cells, besides Methotrexate and Etoposide, Doxorubicin also increased CAV1 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Anti-neoplastic drugs increase CAV1 expression in colon and breast cancer cell lines</title><p>Colon cancer cells <bold>(A)</bold> HT29(US), <bold>(B)</bold> DLD-1, <bold>(C)</bold> HT29(ATCC) and breast cancer cells <bold>(D)</bold> MCF-7 were treated with 100 nM Methotrexate (MT), 10 &#x003bc;M Etoposide (ET), 1 &#x003bc;M Doxorubicin (DX), 5 nM Staurosporine (ST), 5 nM Taxol (TX) or 100 nM Cisplatin (CP) for 24 h.

These results suggest that enhanced expression of CAV1 observed in carcinoma cells following exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs is necessary and sufficient to promote tumor cell metastasis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>CAV1 plays a dual role in the development of cancer. At early stages it is considered a tumor suppressor and at later stages it contributes to a more aggressive phenotype [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In part, CAV1 does so by modulating drug pump expression and function [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This requires extensive periods of exposure to drugs. For instance, incubation of HT29(US) cells with increasing concentrations of Etoposide (50 &#x02013; 1000 nM) gradually increased CAV1 levels over extended periods of time (approx. 3-6 months) and this increase correlated with enhanced multi-drug resistance (Montoya and Quest, unpublished data). These observations are consistent with the classic view that malignant cancer cell traits are acquired as a consequence of a long-term selection process. However, the findings presented here point towards the existence of mechanisms by which short-term (24-48 h exposure) exposure to anti-neoplastic drugs induces changes particularly in CAV1 expression that favor the acquisition of a more aggressive, metastatic phenotype. These findings are consistent with predictions made by the phenotype-switching model suggesting that rapid changes in cancer cell behavior can be triggered by &#x0201c;environmental&#x0201d; factors [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>Chemotherapy remains an important and effective treatment for early stage cancer; however, resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents poses a tremendous challenge, and represents a major obstacle in the treatment of cancer, which may potentially lead to tumor relapse and failure of the therapy [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The mechanisms contributing to drug resistance either reduce effective intracellular drug concentration and/or reduce sensitivity to the drugs. Here we show that the treatment with several anti-neoplastic drugs at generally sub-cytotoxic concentrations induced up-regulation of CAV1. For Methotrexate and Etoposide, we further show that this increase is associated with enhanced cell migration, invasion and metastasis, and therefore, with a more malignant phenotype.</p><p>Two major types of epigenetic alterations closely linked to cancer are aberrant DNA methylation and covalent histone modifications [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The 5&#x02019; region of the <italic>caveolin-1</italic> promoter is enriched in CpG islands that are not methylated in normal breast epithelial cells and express higher levels of CAV1; however, in breast cancer cell lines that do not express CAV1, this region is highly methylated [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The methylation pattern of the CAV1 promoter also changes according to the level of malignancy and metastatic potential in breast cancer tumors [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In HT29 colon cancer cells, CAV1 expression is silenced by treatment of the cells with butyrate, which induces histone hyperacetylation among other effects [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Thus both modes of regulation have been implicated in CAV1 silencing in cancer cells. Here we show that suppression of basal CAV1 expression in the colon and breast cancer cells employed in our studies is reverted by inhibition of DNA methylation using 5-aza dideoxycytidine. Also, we provide direct evidence in DNA immunoprecipitation assays using methylation-specific antibodies that the <italic>CAV1</italic> promoter region is demethylated upon exposure of colon cancer cells to Methotrexate or Etoposide.</p><p>An important objective of the present study was to show that although these drugs elicit their cytotoxic effects via distinct mechanisms when engaging tumor cells, they increased the expression of CAV1 even at sub-cytotoxic concentrations by triggering signaling pathways commonly associated with tumor survival and progression. Indeed, consistent with this view, induction of CAV1 expression by either Methotrexate or Etoposide was very effectively blocked by the MEK inhibitor (PD98059) and the anti-oxidant Trolox in both HT29(US) and DLD-1 cells. However, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, was only effective in blocking drug-induced CAV1 expression in HT29(US) cells, but not in DLD-1 cells. In HT29(US) cells, inhibition of the PI3K pathway using the Aurora kinase inhibitor A has been linked to the induction of autophagy [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and this may explain why LY294002 blocked induction of CAV1 by both Methotrexate and Etoposide in HT29(US) but not DLD1 cells.</p><p>All the anti-neoplastic drugs employed, increased CAV1 expression in the colon cancer cell line HT29(US), although increases were most significant for Methotrexate and Etoposide. These were the only two drugs that increased significantly CAV1 protein levels in the other colon cancer cell line DLD-1 and the breast cancer cell line MCF7. Importantly, Methotrexate and Etoposide increased the mRNA and protein levels of CAV1 in colon and breast cancer cells. Several transcription factors are known to regulate the expression of CAV1 during cancer progression. In human lung cancer cells, CAV1 expression is up-regulated by PEA3/E1AF and down-regulated by Net/Elk-3 [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Also, activation of PPAR&#x003b3; correlates with an increase in CAV1 mRNA in breast and colon cancer cells [<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and RANKL up-regulates CAV1 during osteoclastogenesis [<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].

Therefore, CAV1 up-regulation by exposure to the chemotherapeutic agents Methotrexate or Etoposide (the drugs we characterized in greater detail here) could be due to activation of one or several of these transcription factors, and additional studies are required to define those involved.</p><p>Methotrexate and Etoposide increased mRNA and protein levels of CAV1 in colon and breast cancer cells through activation of the MEK/ERK pathway and the subsequent increase in ROS levels. In neuronal cells, Etoposide and Doxorubicin increased ROS via FOXO3 activation, which alone suffices to trigger bursts of ROS and then apoptosis [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In primary human lung cells, TIG-3, via the Ras/MEK pathway, induced the expression of superoxide-generating NADPH oxidases (Nox), such as Nox4, leading to an increase in intracellular ROS levels [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Also, in monocytic cells, stimulation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and 2 (TLR2) induces the IRAK-ERK pathway that connects to p67 phox-Nox2 for ROS generation, which regulate IL-1&#x003b2; transcription and processing [<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Taken together, these observations suggest that Nox family members could be involved in the mechanisms that up-regulate CAV1 expression after exposure to anti-neoplastic drugs. This is an intriguing possibility that needs to be addressed in future studies.</p><p>Upon upregulation, CAV1 can be phosphorylated on tyrosine 14 (Y14), by Src-family kinases. Phosphorylation of CAV1 at this site has been linked to increased anchorage-independent growth and cell migration by a mechanism dependent on Grb7 [<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Matrix metalloproteinase activation has been described in large cell lung carcinoma, where elevated CAV1 expression correlates with advanced stages of lung cancer as well as increased MMP9/MMP2 expression and activity. Knockdown of CAV-1 in H460 and 9D5 cells decreases the protein levels, as well as MMP9/MMP2 activity [<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Moreover, cell invasion [<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and expression of the matrix metalloproteinase genes MMP1 and MMP2 are significantly enhanced by CAV1 in glioblastoma cells [<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Here we show that pre-treatment with an inhibitor of the Src-family kinases (PP2) blocked the increase in cell migration and invasion in colon and breast cancer cells and that CAV1 silencing decreased particularly MMP9 activity induced by the anti-neoplastic drugs. Available evidence indicates that cytosolic ROS activate Src-family kinases [<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], which may phosphorylate CAV1 [<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] to enhance cell migration. Additional targets of cytosolic ROS are the Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) [<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and structural proteins such as &#x003b2;-actin [<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Both Src and FAK are initiators of focal adhesion formation in adherent cells, which upon activation favor cell spreading and migration [<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p>Further studies are required to define the mechanisms by which the increase in ROS production induced by Methotrexate or Etoposide promote cell migration in a CAV1-dependent manner. However, given that ROS activate Src-family kinases and the inhibitor PP2 reduces CAV1-enhanced migration, these kinases are likely to be involved. Moreover, we have previously shown that CAV1 phosphorylation on tyrosine-14 leads to activation of a novel Rab5-Tiam1-Rac1 signalng axis important in migration and invasion of cancer cells [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Consistent with the possibility that this pathway may be relevant here, transfection with the dominant negative Rac(S17N) mutant completely abolished Methotrexate- and Etoposide-induced DLD-1 invasion. Rather surprisingly, however, while the Tiam-1/Trio inhibitor (NSC23766) effectively reduced invasion of both HT29(US) and DLD-1 cells observed after Etoposide exposure, this was not the case following Methotrexate treatment, indicating that other Rac1 GEFs are likely to be involved downstream of CAV1.</p><p>Augmented CAV1 expression is frequently linked to enhanced metastatic potential of cancer cells (reviewed in [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]). As anticipated, knock-down of CAV1 efficiently reduced infiltation of several organs (liver, kidney, spleen) by HT29(US) cells in the carcinomatosis assay. However, the treatment with Methotrexate or Etoposide prior to injection of cells did not increase metastasis in this manner. Thus, we also evaluated accumulation of cells in the ascites fluid, which is a more sensitve marker and observed for Methotrexate treated cells a highly significant increase in cell number, while for Etoposide a trend was apparent but differences to controls were not significant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11B</xref>). It is interesting to speculate here that the pronounced difference observed for Methotrexate may relate to the increased relevance of PI3K activation in CAV1 induction in HT29(US) cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).</p><p>Augmented CAV1 expression has been associated previously with progression towards a more aggressive cancer phenotype, for instance for prostate cancer and melanomas [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], although in those cases the precise mechanisms involved were not defined. The novelty of the findings reported here resides in showing that exposure of cancer cells to anti-neoplastic drugs at sub-cytotoxic concentrations may induce signaling events and changes in transcription that favor a more aggressive metastatic phenotype in the absence of selection for drug-resistance. Whether similar mechanisms are relevant in cases where CAV1 upregulation occurs in the absence of drug exposure remains to be defined.</p><p>We propose the working model shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>, which is consistent with most of the data shown here. In breast and colon cancer cells, CAV1 expression is repressed by methylation; however, exposure to Methotrexate or Etoposide, and presumably other cytotoxic drugs, induces <italic>CAV1</italic> transcription, likely via promoter demethylation, and CAV1 expression mediated by ERK phosphorylation/activation and ROS production. Additionally, ROS are shown to promote Src-family kinase activation, CAV1 phosphorylation on Y14 and downstream Rac1 activation, which is indicated here as being responsible for metalloproteinase activation, increased migration, invasion and metastasis.</p><fig id="F12" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 12</label><caption><title>Working model summarizing the main findings described in this study identifying the mechanisms by which cytotoxic drugs induce CAV1 expression</title><p>Initially, CAV1 expression is repressed by methylation in the gene promoter region in tumor cells.
