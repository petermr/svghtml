Multiple adult ICU trials have suggested that optimization of vitamin D status through high-dose supplementation may reduce mortality and improve other clinically relevant outcomes; however, there have been no trials of rapid normalization in the PICU setting. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an enteral weight-based cholecalciferol loading dose regimen in critically ill children with VDD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The VITdAL-PICU pilot study is designed as a multicenter placebo-controlled phase II dose evaluation pilot randomized controlled trial. We aim to randomize 67 VDD critically ill children using a 2:1 randomization schema to receive loading dose enteral cholecalciferol (10,000&#x000a0;IU/kg, maximum of 400,000&#x000a0;IU) or a placebo solution.&#x000a0;Participants, caregivers and outcome assessors will be blinded to allocation. Eligibility criteria include ICU patient, aged 37&#x000a0;weeks to 18&#x000a0;years, expected ICU length of stay more than&#x02009;48&#x000a0;h, anticipated&#x000a0;access to bloodwork at 7&#x000a0;days, and VDD (blood total 25 hydroxyvitamin D &#x0003c;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;nmol/L). The primary objective is to determine whether the dosing protocol normalizes vitamin D status, defined as a blood total 25(OH)D concentration above 75&#x000a0;nmol/L. Secondary objectives include an examination of the safety of the dosing regimen (e.g. hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis), measures of vitamin D axis function (e.g. calcitriol levels, immune function), and protocol feasibility (eligibility criteria, protocol deviations, blinding).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Despite significant observational literature suggesting VDD to be a modifiable risk factor in the PICU setting, there is no robust clinical trial evidence evaluating the benefits of rapid normalization.

Study findings will be used to inform the design of a multicenter phase III trial evaluating the clinical and economic benefits to rapid normalization.

These observations are concerning as vitamin D is accepted as a pleiotropic hormone important for the proper functioning of organ systems central to the progression of critical illness. VDD has been implicated in the health and stress response of the cardiovascular, immune, respiratory, and neurological systems. The biological mechanisms through which VDD may contribute to primary or secondary ICU pathophysiology have been discussed in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Multiple observational studies have established an association between lower vitamin D levels and worse clinical outcomes in critically ill children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These same findings are well established in the adult intensive care unit (ICU) setting, with cumulative results on tens of thousands of critically ill adults reporting associations between hormone level and organ dysfunction, health resource utilization, and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In 2014, two systematic reviews and meta-analyses of adult ICU observational data independently concluded that a total 25 hydroxyvitamin D level, 25(OH)D, below 50&#x000a0;nmol/L was associated with an almost twofold increased risk of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, as the findings are based on data from observational studies, it is important not to draw conclusions on causality as the relationship may be driven by confounding factors.</p><p id="Par17">Multiple adult and pediatric critical care research groups have hypothesized that optimization of vitamin D status could improve clinical outcomes and save health care costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This optimization will require a significant change in the current approach to vitamin D supplementation. Presently, usual care involves the enteral or parenteral administration of between 200 and 1000&#x000a0;IU/day of cholecalciferol. Although widespread, this approach may only minimally benefit patients. Substantial literature from ambulatory populations suggests that administration of low-dose daily supplementation can require months to rebuild body stores and may not be sufficient in some patients. Moreover, emerging evidence from hospitalized and ICU patients suggest that levels often remain constant and may even decline during the first few weeks in the ICU with usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The Institute of Medicine Tolerable Upper Intake Level supports the use of higher daily doses which are age-based and range from 1000 to 4000&#x000a0;IU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Although this would be an improvement, a recent systematic review by our group identified that these doses still require at least a month to normalize vitamin D status in those who are VDD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This timeframe would be reasonable in the outpatient settings, but may not be optimal in critical illness where prolonged periods of VDD could contribute to secondary pathology, protracted recovery, and may influence long-term quality of life. Consequently, alternative approaches to vitamin D supplementation will be required to rapidly optimize vitamin D status in the ICU setting. The high VDD rates in critically ill patients, while concerning, could also present a unique opportunity to improve outcomes following the critical stages of illness once an ICU-specific approach to vitamin D supplementation is identified.</p><p id="Par18">Recognizing that vitamin D is a safe, simple, and inexpensive intervention, multiple adult ICU research groups have proceeded to randomized controlled trials (RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Of these, two RCTs have been especially important in demonstrating the benefit of vitamin D supplementation in ICU. Both trials sought to rapidly normalize vitamin D status in ICU, over 2 to 5&#x000a0;days, using enteral loading dose cholecalciferol therapy. VITdAL-ICU, the only phase III trial to date, reported that administration of a single enteral cholecalciferol loading dose (540,000&#x000a0;IU) to VDD critically ill adults reduced mortality in those with severe deficiency and improved long-term functional outcomes in those with more moderate deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Second, the RCT by Han and colleagues comparing 250,000 and 500,000&#x000a0;IU enteral cholecalciferol (divided over 5&#x000a0;days) with placebo in critically ill ventilated adults reported a statistically significant reduction in length of stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Two adult systematic reviews with meta-analyses published in late 2016 suggested that high-dose vitamin D has the potential to reduce ICU mortality and length of stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Although encouraging, the findings from adult trials are not directly transferrable to the PICU setting and clinical trials will be required to address the unique characteristics of children. Primary among the issues to be resolved include establishing a dosing regimen that safely allows for rapid normalization of vitamin D status across a broad range of pediatric ages and conditions. We recently performed a systematic review and meta-regression of pediatric high-dose vitamin D trials to help inform the dosing regimen for a rapid normalization RCT in the PICU setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This analysis identified weight-based enteral loading therapy of 10,000&#x000a0;IU/kg, up to a maximum of 400,000&#x000a0;IU, as the dosing regimen most likely to rapidly and safely normalize levels (in unwell VDD children). Although not commonly used in North America, intermittent or loading dose cholecalciferol is well studied for the prevention and treatment of rickets in many countries and is included in reviews and positions statements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. That said, as concern persists about the safety of high-dose vitamin D, we completed a meta-analysis of clinical trial data which failed to identify evidence of toxicity until doses generated group average 25(OH)D level above 200&#x000a0;nmol/L (consistent with dosing above 400,000&#x000a0;IU). The dosing regimen identified in our meta-analysis should avoid the supraphysiological concentrations (&#x0003e;&#x02009;200&#x000a0;nmol/L) associated with toxicity in the majority of patients. While data from this extensive review support the efficacy and safety of this dose, rigorous clinical trials are required before it can become part of standard care in PICU.</p><p id="Par20">In collaboration with the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group (CCCTG), we propose a placebo-controlled phase II dose evaluation pilot trial of a weight-based enteral loading dose of cholecalciferol in critically ill children with vitamin D deficiency. The primary objective of the VITdAL-PICU pilot study is to determine whether the dosing regimen can rapidly normalize vitamin D levels in critically ill children with VDD. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety of the dosing regimen (e.g., hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia), improved vitamin D axis functioning (e.g., active hormone levels and calcium metabolism), and differences in blood measures of inflammation and innate immunity (e.g., C-reactive protein and procalcitonin) compared to placebo. Tertiary feasibility objectives are to assess adherence to the treatment protocol (including blinding), assess the appropriateness of our eligibility criteria for the full trial, and estimate the rate of patient recruitment while understanding barriers to recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par21">This study was designed as a placebo-controlled dose evaluation pilot RCT. Although the placebo group is not directly relevant to our primary objective of dose evaluation, this study design is essential to allow us to address our secondary and tertiary objectives. The inclusion of a placebo group will allow us to describe blood or urine calcium levels (i.e., surrogates of vitamin D toxicity) for children who are and are not exposed to the rapid restoration dose. Further, the placebo arm is required to properly evaluate recruitment and our ability to achieve blinding.

Prior to the initiation of recruitment, the FastPak&#x000ae; was validated, and a proficiency certificate was obtained from the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme (DEQAS) group for meeting the performance targets set by their advisory panel for 25(OH)D assays (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

A 2:1 randomization (high dose: placebo) schema was employed because the control group is not directly pertinent for our primary objective of dose evaluation but required to assess our secondary objectives. The secondary objectives can be properly assessed with a smaller control group. Therefore, in order to avoid enrolling more participants than necessary, and to improve the feasibility of this dose evaluation study by minimizing costs, the decision was made to use 2:1 randomization. We have decided to stratify by age as neonates can respond uniquely to medications due to different water/fat content, hepatic, and renal functioning. Further, calcium homeostasis and the definition of abnormal for both hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria are different for neonates. Stratification by neonatal status will ensure that these differences are equally distributed between the two groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Allocation concealment and blinding</title><p id="Par26">The Methods Centre at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute will prepare a computer-generated randomization list. Randomized allocation will be achieved as follows: At enrolment, study staff will record the next available study ID number within the correct stratification group on the study drug order form.

Study personnel (study coordinator, research assistants, principal investigator, co-investigators, site investigators, data management personnel, and statisticians), members of the health care team (treating physicians, bedside nurses, and clinical pharmacists), and patients/families will be blinded to the study group assignment. It is possible that the study safety officer (PG) will become aware of study group allocation. The safety officer, who does not contribute to the medical care of the patients, will review each study participant&#x02019;s vitamin D level from the day 7 blood sample to identify participants at potential risk for vitamin D toxicity (25(OH)D &#x0003e;&#x02009;200&#x000a0;nmol/L) in real-time. Since it is expected that the vitamin D level of patients in the control group will not increase significantly from the time when they met eligibility criteria (25(OH)D &#x0003c;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;nmol/L), the safety officer will likely be able to determine which patients were allocated to the vitamin D treatment arm if their discharge vitamin D level is substantially higher than 50&#x000a0;nmol/L. Otherwise, the assigned intervention will not be revealed until all patients have been discharged from hospital (censored at 90&#x000a0;days), determination of research-related biochemical testing is complete, and the research database has been finalized. To maintain blinding, the randomization lists will only be accessible to the Data Management Services of The Methods Centre at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute and to the research pharmacist(s).

In addition, we will also report on (i) the distribution of 25(OH)D levels on day 7 using means/medians with the appropriate measure of distribution (standard deviation, IQR) and (ii) the number of study participants who developed 25(OH)D levels in excess of 200&#x000a0;nmol/L.</p><p id="Par45">Analyses of secondary outcomes will focus on confidence interval generation. Secondary outcomes will be described by group as means with standard deviations or medians with inter-quartile range values for continuous variables, or as frequencies with percentages for categorical variables (e.g., hypercalciuria, hypercalcemia, nephrocalcinosis). We will also conduct some exploratory evaluations between groups based on data type. Outcome measures that are continuous will be evaluated using the <italic>t</italic> test or Mann-Whitney (where appropriate). Binary secondary outcome measures will be compared between the two treatment groups using Fisher&#x02019;s exact or chi-square test. If randomization does not lead to equal distribution of important variables (e.g., weight), the above analysis will be expanded to regression modeling to allow for adjustment. Results of between group analyses will be considered hypothesis generating.</p><p id="Par46">We will describe 25(OH)D and other biochemical outcomes within three different subgroups. First, we will describe 25(OH)D response in the group of patients under and over 40&#x000a0;kg. Second, we will describe changes in biochemistry and clinical measures separately for the groups with an enrolment 25(OH)D level above and below 30&#x000a0;nmol/L. Third, we will describe 25(OH)D response and clinical measures separately for newborns (age &#x0003c;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;days) versus older children (age &#x0003e;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;days).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Monitoring</title><p id="Par47">The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be comprised of two clinical experts (critical care, nephrology) and a biostatistician and will function independently from the study investigators and the steering committee. The DSMB will review safety data, blinded in aggregate and by study group, after 30 and 53 patients have completed day 7. Specifically, the DSMB will review the occurrence of hypervitaminosis D (25(OH)D &#x0003e;&#x02009;200&#x000a0;nmol/L), vitamin D-related adverse events (hypercalciuria, hypercalcemia), and serious adverse events potentially related to study drug. The DSMB chair will also receive immediate notification and reports of serious adverse events determined to be related to the study drug. In addition, the DSMB chair will receive a report for all deaths and all requirements for renal replacement therapy, regardless of whether they are thought to be related to the VITdAL-PICU pilot study. There would be concern regarding the dosing protocol if more than 10% of participants achieved 25(OH)D levels above 250&#x000a0;nmol/L (even in the absence of clinical sequelae). If this criterion was met, a downward adjustment of the loading dose would be considered.</p><p id="Par48"> Study monitoring at CHEO will be conducted by qualified peer-to-peer monitors. The monitoring review will occur approximately every 3&#x000a0;months or as needed based on enrollment. The principal investigator and the study coordinator will review the study regularly and assess evaluations of patients&#x02019; eligibility, study data, and adverse events in the study database. Study monitoring of sites in Austria and Chile will be performed remotely by the study coordinator and principal investigator.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Ethics and regulatory requirements</title><p id="Par49">Research ethics board approval will be obtained before initiation of recruitment. Protocol amendments will be communicated as necessary to those involved in the study. In Canada, the study protocol was approved by the Children&#x02019;s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Ethics Board (REB reference number 15/18E), and regulatory approval was obtained from Health Canada (control number 184825). In Austria, the study protocol was approved by the Medical University of Graz Ethics Committee (REB reference 28-619 ex 15/16) and regulatory approval was obtained from European Medical Association (EudraCT number 2016-002459-38). The Chilean site obtained approval from the Ethical Scientific Committee of the Concepci&#x000f3;n Health Service (REB reference 16-03-10). Regulatory approval was not required in Chile.

A summary of the study results will be prepared in lay terms and sent by mail to study participants. If funding allows, other knowledge translation methods will be explored, including a decision aid to help families make informed choices around testing vitamin D levels and the options for clinical management of the results, and media tools, pamphlets and posters directed at the general public, ICU patients and families, and physicians.</p><p id="Par52">Data analysis will occur at CHEO RI/OHRI. Participant level trial data will not be sent to other sites or researchers. Co-authors may suggest sub-studies and will be given the opportunity to take the lead on manuscript preparation.

An important step towards determining the potential benefit of rapidly normalizing vitamin D status in PICU is the establishment of an evidence-based dosing protocol. This phase II dose evaluation study aims to determine the effectiveness and safety of a weight-based enteral rapid restoration dose of vitamin D in deficient critically ill children and is the first step towards a definitive phase III clinical trial to evaluate both the clinical and economic benefits of rapid normalization in this population.</p><p id="Par54">To facilitate the success of completing this pilot RCT and the subsequent phase III trial, ongoing review, problem identification, with adjustments are imperative. Since initiating recruitment, the authors have implemented a number of modifications to the protocol aimed at increasing feasibility. Although the majority have been minor, a significant change was made to the dosing regimen after 5&#x000a0;months of recruitment (12% of target sample size given two doses). The original protocol included a second loading dose of cholecalciferol on day 3 (if the 25(OH)D level measured on day 3 was not above 75&#x000a0;nmol/L). The second dose was initially included due to concerns that some critically ill children might not achieve target 25(OH)D levels with a single dose, as observed in the similar adult VITdAL-ICU trial. The decision to drop the second dose was based on several factors, including (i) a literature update suggesting that the second load may not be necessary, and evidence suggesting clinical benefit with a single enteral load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]; (ii) concern from other sites suggesting it may prevent their participation; (iii) cost of additional drug and measuring 25(OH)D status on day 3 to determine dosing level; (iv) feedback from participants and potential participants that the study protocol, specifically the day 3 dose, was complicated and difficult to understand which the authors felt may have a negative impact on recruitment rate; and (v) although procedures were put in place to maintain blinding during measurement of 25(OH)D at day 3, the second dose increased the chances of accidental unblinding. Additional, more minor changes, to the protocol are presented and discussed in Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par55">Recruitment for the VITdAL-PICU pilot study started at the Children&#x02019;s Hospital of Eastern Ontario in January 2016. Although initially started as a single center RCT in the PICU, recruitment was expanded to sites in Chile and Austria on May 1, 2017. At the time of manuscript acceptance, approximately 95% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;64) of the target sample size has been enrolled.
