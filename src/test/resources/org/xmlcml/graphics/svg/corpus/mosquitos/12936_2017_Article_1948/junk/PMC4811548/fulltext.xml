In marine systems, Territorial User Rights for Fisheries (TURFs) are promoted to enable sustainable use of resources. We investigate the potential for synergies between nature-based tourism and TURFs on Chile&#x02019;s central coast. Of 135 recreational divers surveyed, 77% indicated that the fish species they preferred sighting were declining and 80% indicated that they would dive more often in TURFs, which have higher abundance of favoured species. Regression analysis shows that respondents that perceive that TURFs fulfil a conservation function are more willing to pay to dive in a TURF. However, respondents who understand the bureaucratic functioning of a TURF are less willing to pay, and there is diversity in how divers feel payments should be made. A participatory approach is required to navigate these complexities to achieve synergies between nature-based tourism and resource harvesting in TURFs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>FONDECYT (project 11070034) Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio of the Ministerio de Economia, Fomento y Turismo grants RC130024 and NC 120086 and financiamiento Basal FB0002.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The biodiversity crisis is worsening amidst increasing pressure on natural resources. Innovative strategies to conserve biodiversity, whilst allowing for resource use by local communities are urgently needed [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148862.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148862.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In marine systems, territorial user rights for fisheries (TURFS) have been promoted over the past decade as an instrument which can enable the sustainable utilisation of marine resources by providing appropriate access rights and incentives [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148862.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. At the same time, in both marine and terrestrial systems, nature-based tourism has been widely promoted as a way to achieve both economic gains and conservation [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Nature-based tourism in marine environments has typically centred around coral reefs, or iconic marine species such as whales and sharks [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148862.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Marine tourism not associated with iconic mammals or coral reefs receives less attention but nevertheless, could play an important socio-economic role in temperate ecosystems (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). If the marine diversity and abundance is higher in TURFs than outside of TURFs and if recreational divers have a preference for higher diversity and abundance, the potential for synergies between nature-based tourism and resource extraction in TURFs exists.</p><p>Chile, has a national TURF policy following the 1991 Fishery and Aquaculture Law [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Currently, there are over 800 TURFs in Chile along 2500km of coastline [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148862.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To be granted a TURF, community artisanal fisher associations (hereafter associations) must undertake a baseline study of their TURF and develop management plans with the aid of technical assistance that need to be approved by the undersecretary of fisheries. These fisher associations are responsible for the surveillance and enforcement with support from the National Fisheries Service [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. TURF management plans consider economically valuable benthic species, and it is forbidden to extract benthic species not considered in the management plan. Recently, the biodiversity conservation implications of TURFs began to be assessed scientifically [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Results of these studies showed that TURFs in kelp forests can sustain significantly higher reef fish and macroinvertebrate species richness, biomass, and density compared with kelp forests in open-access areas which have the same habitat complexity characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148862.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, results show that TURFs with different enforcement levels had significant differences in macroinvertebrate species richness, density, and biomass, suggesting that the level of enforcement, aimed at preventing poaching in TURFs, is associated with biological diversity [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148862.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These findings from different studies [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148862.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148862.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148862.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] suggest that beyond possible consequences of site-selection bias, species diversity patterns within TURFs are driven, to some extent, by enforcement and management over time. In this sense, well-enforced TURFs (i.e. those with surveillance agreements in place) have been proposed to play an important role as ancillary marine conservation instruments [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148862.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In addition, Chile also has a growing nature-based tourism industry (SERNATUR 2012). However, to date, the potential synergies between TURFS and nature-based marine tourism have not been investigated. Presently, there are no clear regulations to support or prohibit recreational diving in TURFs, and there is uncertainty among divers about access rules and procedures. Our paper addresses this gap by investigating the potential benefit of integrating recreational diving in the management and income generation strategies of TURFs. To our knowledge, this is the first study that empirically examines the potential for synergies between extractive use, recreational use, and conservation within TURFs.</p><p>Specifically, our study aimed to address the following questions: 1) what is the perception among recreational divers of the changing state of marine life, and whether this is related to diver experience; 2) which marine species do recreational divers prefer to observe; 3) what is the perception of TURFs among divers, and are they willing to pay a user fee to access TURFs with greater biodiversity and abundance; and finally 4) which variables predict the willingness of recreational divers to pay a visitor&#x02019;s fee to dive in TURFs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>The study area</title><p>Currently in Chile there are around 800 TURFs legally allocated to fisher organizations [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] out of which around 450 are fully functioning [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Although there is heterogeneity in their performance, they account for more than 1,100 km2 of the nearshore seascape, with an average size of approximately 100 hectares and an average distance between them of 4&#x02013;10 km [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The seascape between TURFs are de facto open access areas. TURFs are created and assessed to manage economically important benthic species such as the carnivorous muricid gastropod Concholepas concholepas (managed in 80% of TURFs), key-hole limpets, <italic>Fissurella</italic> spp. (70%), and the red sea urchin <italic>Loxechinus albus</italic> (30%) and more recently for algae species (Castilla et al. 1998; Castilla et al. 2007). Diving for benthic resources within the TURF is usually restricted to a few times a month [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In fact, the average income for fisher associations which comes from resources from within the TURFs is around 20% [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Under these circumstances, the potential for developing tourism within TURFs and establish synergies between TURFs used for extracting resources and as a tourist destination is possible. To explore these possible synergies, research surveyed recreational divers who usually dive in central Chile between Pichidangui (32&#x000b0;08&#x02032;00&#x02033;S 71&#x000b0;32&#x02032;00&#x02033;W) and Pichilemu (34&#x000b0; 23&#x02032; 0&#x02033; S, 72&#x000b0; 0&#x02032; 0&#x02033; W), where there are currently around 80 TURFs granted to fisher associations and where recreational diving has experienced an important growth in the past ten years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148862.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0148862.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0148862.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Map of the study area.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0148862.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Surveys</title><p>We surveyed 135 recreational scuba divers using an online survey (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://es.surveymonkey.org">es.surveymonkey.org</ext-link>).

We pre-tested the survey tool with 25 recreational divers. Fisheries scientists and marine biologists were explicitly excluded from the survey in the invitation letter and through a screening question. Recreational scuba divers do not practice spear-fishing in Chile, and recreational free-divers and artisanal spear-fishers were excluded from the dataset.

Divers were asked to respond to the statements, &#x02018;when I see more fish, diving is better&#x02019;; &#x02018;I see more species in TURFs than in open access areas&#x02019;; &#x02018;the same species that I see in open access areas grow to a larger size in TURFs&#x02019;; and &#x02018;the same species that I see in open access areas occur in greater abundance in TURFs on a 5 point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). In addition, the marine species that recreational divers prefer to observe was assessed by asking open-ended questions in which respondents indicated which three marine fish and invertebrates they most like to observe. Divers were asked whether or not they think TURFs fulfil a conservation role on a 5 point Likert scale (1 = insignificant role to 5 = a very important role).</p><p>Respondents who are aware of TURFs and their bureaucratic and administrative functioning may be more or less likely to be willing to pay to access TURFs for recreational diving. Whilst there is an increasing willingness to pay entry fees to access marine reserves, a lack of trust in the collection agency and how the money will be spent deters the willingness to pay [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, respondents who do not trust the way income to TURFs will be managed, and may feel that they are characterised by excessive bureaucracy and red tape, superfluous administrative procedures, and do not trust money will be spent efficiently are likely to be less inclined to want to pay to access these sites for diving [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148862.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Respondents that trust that TURFs are administrated in an efficient fashion without superfluous bureaucracy are more likely to be willing to pay additional charges to access these sites for diving. We measured whether or not recreational divers understood how TURFs function in terms of structure and bureaucracy (binary variable), and whether they felt TURFs fulfilled a conservation function (measured on a 5 point Likert scale). In addition, we collected data on the characteristics of trips undertaken by recreational divers including the number of hours normally travelled to a diving site. We used a four-point scale on whether or not divers had experienced problems trying to dive in TURFs before (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148862.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Finally, as the response variable for the willingness to pay analysis, respondents were asked how much they would be willing to pay to dive in a well enforced TURF with greater diversity and abundance of commercial and non-commercially valuable marine reef-fish species and invertebrates. The diversity and abundance data of fish and invertebrates used in the survey came from empirical surveys and photographs of TURFs in central Chile [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Respondents could choose that they were not willing to pay at all, that they would pay up to US$6 or that they would be willing to pay more than US$6. A US$6 fee was used, as this is the median price for an entry fee for a natural protected area in the national system for protected areas of Chile [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition, respondents were asked whether payments should be made directly to associations or whether it should be managed by a third party such as a foundation or an NGO. In addition the survey asked whether such a payment should be a voluntary donation only.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Analysis</title><p>We assessed whether perceptions of the changing state of marine life was related to diver experience using Kendall tau&#x02019;s correlation coefficient.

Our results show that the majority of recreational divers are willing to contribute to the management costs of TURFs through paying an access fee. Thus, there is potential to synergise income from nature-based tourism with sustainable use on Chile&#x02019;s central coast. However, our results suggest that the lack of trust in the efficient functioning of the administration of a TURF and how the entry fee to TURFs may be managed and used presents a challenge to harnessing implementing an entry fee system.</p><sec id="sec009"><title>Perceptions of decline and preferences to dive in TURFs</title><p>Respondents perceive fish and invertebrates are in decline, this aligns with scientific findings of the state of coastal Chile&#x02019;s marine ecosystems [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148862.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Respondents prefer to dive where there is higher diversity and higher abundance of large fish and invertebrates. The majority of respondents indicated they would dive more often and that they are willing to pay to enter areas with higher abundance and diversity. Our findings align with studies in tropical coral reef environments where higher levels of coral and fish abundance and diversity, and reef structural complexity are valued by recreational divers in the Carribean island of Bonaire [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148862.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>The preferences of recreational divers suggest that there is an opportunity to augment income to TURFs through nature-based tourism.

This communication must also consider design choices regarding possible interference between fishing and tourism activities, and ensure that trust between recreational divers and fishers is built. Indeed, in the Community Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE) in Zimbabwe, the presence of clear lines of communication between community user groups, local government and recreational hunting companies enabled trust between stakeholders, and was key to the successful development of CAMPFIRE [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148862.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>Importantly, obtaining an estimate of the total potential contribution of nature-based tourism to the management costs of TURFs was not our intention in this study.

However, our aim was to explore whether recreational divers would in principle be willing to pay an entry to TURFs and which variables predict that willingness.

Our results show that 21% of the sampled divers are willing to pay more than six dollars for accessing TURFs, while Gelcich and others [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] show that 20% of nature based tourists would pay more than US$6 to visit the Lafcken Mapu Lahual MPA in southern Chile. This study provides information on the value TURFs could have for recreational divers and the types of social and institutional considerations that need to be accounted for, if a scheme whereby divers pay to access TURFs is established. A further study will be required to obtain an accurate estimate of the total potential contributing of recreational divers to the management costs of TURFs in Chile.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Complexities of collecting and managing visitor fees</title><p>The reticence of recreational divers who understand how TURFs function to pay entrance fees and the heterogeneity of TURF associations in central Chile, suggests that a diversity of approaches are required to successfully design a system for recreational divers access and fee collection. TURF associations vary with respect to their assets, access to credits and existing infrastructure [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], as well as different habitat types they occupy.</p><p>Moreover, there is wide variation in income streams to TURF associations. Some have transitioned to tourism-driven forms of income and have systems in place for tourists to pay for services such as fishing access, beach services and others). Other associations are still fully dependent on fishing operations as a source of income as they are distant from large populations of potential tourists, and/or there are infrastructure constraints in accessing dive sites. Different associations have varying levels of capacity to manage the collection of visitor fees, and the trust of divers in each association to manage fees efficiently will differ. For example, in the Maitencillo TURF, beach tourism is already an important source of income and there are fee collection and corresponding management processes in place (M. Herrera, secretary of Maitencillo Association, pers. Comm). TURFs like Maitencillo are therefore more likely to be open to allowing divers to access their TURF for diving purposes, than a TURF association that has never had an experience with any form of tourism. Similarly divers are more likely to have confidence in the way dive access fees are managed, if they perceive that TURF associations have experience managing such fees and are well governed. Indeed, the history of co-management in Chile demonstrates the importance of accounting for local variations, and long-standing institutional practices in the establishment of new management systems [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>An over-arching coordinating organisation can often play the role as mediator between the tourist and the community groups responsible for delivering a nature-based experience and managing a resource [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. If such an organisation is established in a way that has the trust of the nature-based tourists visiting these resources, and has an explicit conservation aim, such an organisation may hold a greater level of trust among recreational divers, and they may be more willing to pay to access TURFs [<xref rid="pone.0148862.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148862.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. To explore the potential of these different alternatives we advocate for further research aimed at developing a customer driven design of such a brokering system. This research should aim at understanding the key issues which are important for both fisher associations and the demand from tourists and include these aspects in the design of the business model which aims to promote tourism within TURFs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our paper shows that the preferences of recreational divers to see a greater diversity of fish and invertebrates can be satisfied by gaining access to well enforced TURFs and that they are willing to contribute through an entrance fee to the management costs of TURFs. The design and implementation of such a system will need to account for the diversity of local circumstances in central Chile and needs to address the issue of trust. Our findings suggest that there is potential to synergise nature-based tourism, and sustainable utilisation in marine environments, but that to successfully harness this potential, careful consideration of the local social context will be needed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0148862.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Dataset for this study, with identifying information removed.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0148862.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0148862.s002"><label>S1 Survey Tool</label><caption><title>The survey tool used for this study.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0148862.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge the financial support of Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio of the Ministerio de Economia, Fomento y Turismo grants RC130024 and NC 120086 and financiamiento Basal FB0002.
