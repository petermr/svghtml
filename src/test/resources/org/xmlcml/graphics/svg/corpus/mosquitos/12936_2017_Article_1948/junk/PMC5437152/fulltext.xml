In this study, we show that in the vine, the expression of genes related to the biosynthesis of ABA (<italic>VvNCED1; VvNCED2</italic>) and the content of ABA are significantly higher in the latent bud than at the shoot apex, while the expression of an ABA catabolic gene (<italic>VvA8H3</italic>) showed no significant difference between either organ. A negative correlation between the content of ABA and transcript levels of cell cycle genes (CCG) was found in both tissues. This result suggested that ABA may negatively regulate the expression of CCG in meristematic tissues of grapevines. To test this proposition, the effect of ABA on the expression of CCG was analyzed in two meristematic tissues of the vine: somatic embryos and shoot apexes. The results indicated that cell cycle progression is repressed by ABA in both organs, since it down-regulated the expression of genes encoding cyclin-dependent kinases (<italic>VvCDKB1, VvCDKB2</italic>) and genes encoding cyclins of type A (<italic>VvCYCA1, VvCYCA2, VvCYCA3</italic>), B (<italic>VvCYCB</italic>), and D (<italic>VvCYCD3.2a</italic>) and up-regulated the expression of <italic>VvICK5</italic>, a gene encoding an inhibitor of CDKs. During ED, the content of ABA increased, and the expression of CCG decreased. Moreover, the dormancy-breaking compound hydrogen cyanamide (HC) reduced the content of ABA and up-regulated the expression of CCG, this last effect was abolished when HC and ABA were co-applied. Taken together, these results suggest that ABA-mediated repression of CCG transcription may be part of the mechanism through which ABA modulates the development of ED in grapevine buds.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>abscisic acid (ABA)</kwd><kwd>cell cycle genes</kwd><kwd>endodormancy</kwd><kwd>grapevine buds</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient&#x000ed;fico y Tecnol&#x000f3;gico<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002850</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">1140318</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="39"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The central role of the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) in the control of seed dormancy is well established (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Graeber et al., 2012</xref>). However, its role in the control of bud dormancy in woody perennials is not well defined. In poplar, the participation of ABA in the development of endodormancy (ED) induced by a short-day (SD)-photoperiod has been proposed, as both the content of ABA and ABA biosynthesis related genes peaked after 3&#x02013;4 weeks of SD-treatment (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Arora et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Rohde and Bhalerao, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Ruttink et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, in parallel to increases in ABA content, several cell cycle genes (CCG) show decreased expression (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Ruttink et al., 2007</xref>). However, because the content of ABA is very low when the dormant state is achieved (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Ruttink et al., 2007</xref>), some doubts have been raised regarding the role of ABA in maintaining dormancy (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Olsen, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to poplar and other tree species, <italic>Vitis</italic> does not set a terminal bud in response to SD-photoperiod, and the shoot apex does not enter ED, but the latent buds do (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000fc;hn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Grant et al., 2013</xref>). During ED, the expression of ABA biosynthesis-related genes increased, while the expression of ABA catabolism-related genes decreased, and the content of ABA increased (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). Exogenous application of ABA inhibited the release of buds from ED and attenuated the effect of the dormancy-breaking compound hydrogen cyanamide (HC), which promoted bud release (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, a SD photoperiod triggered the development of ED in grapevine buds (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000fc;hn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Grant et al., 2013</xref>) and up-regulated the expression of ABA biosynthesis-related genes <italic>VvNCED1</italic> and <italic>VvNCED2</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Parada et al., 2016</xref>). All this evidence supports the hypothesis that ABA promotes ED in grapevine buds. However, how this occurs is not well understood. ED, or winter rest, is characterized by reduced activity of the meristem of the latent bud and by the lack of response to growth-promoting stimuli (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Rohde and Bhalerao, 2007</xref>). ABA and other hormones, such as gibberellins (GAs), auxin and cytokinin (CK) are well known to control the expression of CCG, which is certainly relevant in the development of ED (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Progression of the cell cycle is primarily controlled by universally conserved cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Pines, 1995</xref>). Eight classes of CDKs were defined in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> based on phylogenetic analyses (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Vandepoele et al., 2002</xref>), but only the CDKA and CDKB groups have been well studied. CDKA is closely related to yeast Cdcd2/Cdc28 and to human CDK1, CDK2, and CDK3 (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Hirt et al., 1992</xref>). CDKB is a plant-specific CDK that can be divided into two subgroups, CDKB1 and CDKB2. <italic>CDKB1</italic> transcripts accumulate during S, G2 and M phase, and in barley, this gene is down-regulated by ABA (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Gendreau et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>CDKB2</italic> expression is specific to the G2 and M phases. CDK activity is negatively regulated by binding of the INHIBITOR OF CDK/KIP-RELATED PROTEIN (ICK) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">De Veylder et al., 2001</xref>). ICK induces arrest or delay of the cell cycle in response to intra- or extracellular signals (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Verkest et al., 2005</xref>). The activity and substrate specificity of CDKs are dependent upon their association with cyclins (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Morgan, 1995</xref>). In plants, type A, B and D cyclins are thought to play a major role in cell cycle control (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">de Jager et al., 2001</xref>). The A- and B-type cyclins are expressed from S to M phase and control DNA replication, the G2/M transition and mitosis. The D-type cyclins are thought to be sensors of external signals and to play an essential role in cell cycle progression and in the entry of quiescent cells into the cell cycle (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kono et al., 2007</xref>). In the <italic>Vitis</italic> genome, the following cell cycle related genes have been identified: three CDKs, <italic>VvCDKA, VvCDKB1</italic> and <italic>VvCDKB2</italic>; two ICKs, <italic>VvICK5, VvICK7</italic>; two ICK-like genes, <italic>VvICK3-like, VvICK7-like</italic>; three type A cyclins, <italic>VvCYCA1, VvCYCA2</italic>, and <italic>VvCYCA3</italic>; one type B cyclin, <italic>VvCYCB</italic>; and three type D cyclins, <italic>VvCYCD3.1, VvCYCD3.2a</italic>, and <italic>VvCYCD3.2b</italic>.</p><p>In this study, we postulated that ABA, by repressing the expression of CCG, can modulate the development of ED in grapevine buds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Material</title><p>Latent buds and the shoot apexes from 8-year-old <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> cv.

On the other hand, ABA induced the expression of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor (<italic>ICK/KRP</italic>) (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1981</xref>), and it has been suggested that ABA blocks cell division at the G1/S transition by increasing the levels of ICK/KRP (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">del Pozo et al., 2005</xref>).

It has been shown that ABA restricts lower bud outgrowth and promotes correlative inhibition in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> axillary buds (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Yao and Finlayson, 2015</xref>). Moreover, these authors showed that CCGs <italic>CYCLIN A2;1</italic> and <italic>PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN1</italic> (<italic>PCNA1</italic>) were suppressed by ABA, suggesting that ABA may inhibit bud growth in part by suppressing elements of the cell cycle machinery.</p><p>In this study, the negative relationship found between the content of ABA and the expression level of the CCG at the shoot apex and the latent buds of grapevines, prompted us to investigate the effect of ABA on the expression of CCG in grapevine buds. The fact that ABA down-regulated the expression of genes encoding type B CDKs (<italic>VvCDKBs</italic>) and cyclins (<italic>VvCYCs</italic>) and up-regulated the expression of a gene encoding a CDK inhibitor (<italic>VvICK5</italic>), concurrently with the fact that the concentration of ABA within buds falls within a physiological range after the exogenous application of a 100 &#x003bc;M ABA solution, suggests that by modulating the expression of the CCG, ABA could arrests the cell-cycle progression and cell division in meristematic tissues of grapevine. Recently, it has been shown that exogenous application of ABA delays the sprouting of buds and attenuates the effect of HC on promoting bud break in single-bud cuttings of grapevines (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). Likewise, the fact that HC besides reducing the content of ABA, up-regulates the expression of CCGs (<italic>VvCDKB1, VvCYCA3</italic>) and down-regulates the expression of cell cycle inhibitors (<italic>VvICK5</italic> and <italic>VvICK7</italic>) suggests that the dormancy breaking effect of HC could be mediated by ABA. In support of this, co-applications of HC and ABA to grapevine buds reduced significantly the expression of CCG relative to HC-treated buds, validating thus the statement that the up-regulation of CCG by HC is mediated by a reduction in ABA content. Other evidence that support the role of ABA in the acquisition and maintenance of ED in grapevine buds is that the SD-photoperiod up-regulates the expression of ABA biosynthetic genes (<italic>VvNCED1, VvNCED2</italic>) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Parada et al., 2016</xref>) and simultaneously triggers ED in grapevine buds (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000fc;hn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Grant et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, when transcript levels of CCG obtained from microarray analysis for bud development of the grape variety Tempranillo grown in the Northern Hemisphere (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">D&#x000ed;az-Riquelme et al., 2012</xref>) were plotted throughout ED, the expression of genes encoding CDKs <italic>VvCDKA, VvCDKB1</italic>, and <italic>VvCDKB2</italic> and cyclins <italic>VvCYCAs</italic> was down-regulated, while the expression of the CDK inhibitor <italic>VvICK5</italic> was up-regulated. This finding agrees with our results obtained with Thompson seedless grapevine buds grown in the Southern Hemisphere. Moreover, the increases in the content of ABA detected by <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al. (2015)</xref> throughout ED in grapevine buds is consistent with results showing a decrease in the expression of CCG, since during ED the bud meristem remains inactive due to the arrest of the cell cycle. Interestingly, HC up-regulated the expression of <italic>VvCDKB1</italic> and <italic>VvCYCAs</italic> but down-regulated the expression of <italic>VvCYCDs</italic>. The D-type cyclins are thought to be sensors of external signals and to play an essential role in the entry of quiescent cells into the cell cycle (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kono et al., 2007</xref>), while type A and B cyclins and the CDK <italic>VvCDKB1</italic> are expressed during the transition from S to M phase and control DNA replication, the G2/M transition, and mitosis. In a previous study, we found that ABA inhibits respiration in dormant grapevine buds (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Parada et al., 2016</xref>), and in this work, we found that ABA inhibits cell-cycle progression. Therefore, the question that emerges is if there is a relationship between mitochondrial respiration and cell-cycle progression in grapevine buds. In mammals, it has been reported that the cyclin B1/Cdk1 complex is capable of increasing mitochondrial respiration, with enhanced oxygen consumption and ATP generation during the G2/M transition phase of the cell cycle by phosphorylating a cluster of mitochondrial proteins, including the complex I subunits in the respiratory chain (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Although this interaction has not been reported in plants, it suggests that ABA may be a master regulator of ED in grapevine buds since the repression of CCG expression could reduce mitochondrial respiration, thus causing the arrest of meristem activity in grapevine buds.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>RV: planification and revision of the manuscript and performed most of the experiments.
