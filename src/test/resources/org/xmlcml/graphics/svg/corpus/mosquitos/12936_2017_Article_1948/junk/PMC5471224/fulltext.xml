Andrographolide (ANDRO), a botanical compound, has a potent anti-inflammatory activity due to its ability to inhibit NF-&#x003ba;B. ANDRO has been also shown to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome, a relevant pathway in NASH. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of ANDRO in NASH and its influence on inflammasome activation in this setting. Thus, mice were fed a choline-deficient-amino-acid&#x02013;defined (CDAA) diet with/without concomitant ANDRO administration (1&#x02009;mg/kg, 3-times/week). Also, we assessed serum levels of alanine-aminotransferase (ALT), liver histology, hepatic triglyceride content (HTC) and hepatic expression of pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic and inflammasome genes. Inflammasome activation was also evaluated in fat-laden HepG2 cells. Our results showed that ANDRO administration decreased HTC and attenuated hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in CDAA-fed mice. ANDRO treatment determined a strong reduction in hepatic macrophage infiltration and reduced hepatic mRNA levels of both pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes. In addition, mice treated with ANDRO showed reduced expression of inflammasome genes. Finally, ANDRO inhibited LPS-induced interleukin-1&#x003b2; expression through NF-&#x003ba;B inhibition in fat-laden HepG2 cells and inflammasome disassembly. In conclusion, ANDRO administration reduces inflammation and fibrosis in experimental NASH. Inflammasome modulation by a NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent mechanism may be involved in the therapeutic effects of ANDRO.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) comprises a spectrum of liver histological alterations ranging from non-inflammatory isolated steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is characterized by steatosis, necro-inflammatory changes and varying degrees of liver fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. NAFLD is considered as a burgeoning health problem currently being the most common causes of chronic liver disease worldwide with an estimated prevalence of 25&#x02013;30% of the general population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. All patients with NAFLD exhibit an increased risk of death linked to type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular risk factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and those with NASH have also an increased liver-related mortality due to the progression to cirrhosis and its complications including hepatocellular carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p>Currently available treatment options for NASH are limited to promotion of lifestyle changes in diet and exercise habits as well as to control of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Among existing medications, only vitamin E and pioglitazone are recommended in selected patients although their long-term benefit has not been demonstrated and safety issues limit their use due to potentially unwanted side-effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Although a number of novel agents have recently entered clinical trials, availability of effective drugs to treat NASH is remains an unmet need<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p>In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of herbal remedies for liver diseases including NAFLD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Interestingly, pre-clinical studies with some of these agents have shown that they are able to modulate insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, and necro-apoptosis, all key factors in NAFLD/NASH pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, translation of this knowledge into the clinic has been rather limited.</p><p>Among the herbal species tested experimentally in models of liver diseases <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic> have been used in ancient oriental and Ayurvedic medicine to treat a myriad of disorders. The major bioactive phytoconstituent of <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic> is Andrographolide (ANDRO), which is thought to be responsible for most of the biological effects of this herbal medicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. ANDRO is a diverse molecule that possesses a broad range of biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antidiabetic, antibacterial, antimalarial, and hepatoprotective properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. ANDRO&#x02019;s mechanism of action are also diverse and include antioxidant capacity, modulation of nitric oxide and prostaglandin production, modulatory action of immune cells and inhibitory effects on NF-kappa B (NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B) transcription factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p>Several reports have shown hepatoprotective ANDRO effects in different experimental models such as carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity, bile duct ligation and Concanavalin A and acetaminophen-induced liver injury (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>). With regard to NAFLD/NASH in particular, data on the potential beneficial effects of ANDRO is scarce. Of note, a recent report by Ding <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> showed that ANDRO was effective in preventing fat accumulation in liver of high-fat diet fed mice through regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) target genes. However, these authors did not explore further the effects of ANDRO on either inflammation or fibrosis in their animals due to shortcomings of the experimental models used.</p><p>Interestingly, due to its mechanisms of action in inflammatory disorders, ANDRO may be a suitable agent for reducing liver injury in the setting of NASH. In particular, ANDRO forms a covalent adduct with NF-&#x003ba;B, thus blocking the binding of NF-&#x003ba;B to nuclear proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Since NFkB seems to be a critical player in NASH progression due to its central role in inflammation control by regulating the inflammatory cells infiltration as well as the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, targeting this pathway maybe of potential benefit in NASH. Of note, NFkB controls interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;) production, which is one of the most important cytokine involved in NASH progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Activation of IL-1&#x003b2; results from an enzymatic process driven by Caspase-1 (CASP-1), which in turn depends of a multi-protein complex, the inflammasome, which have recently been involved in NASH pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Thus, due to its interaction with NF-&#x003ba;B, ANDRO should likely influence this inflammatory pathway in NASH. Moreover, it seems of interest to explore if ANDRO has any effects on the inflammasome pathway in NASH given recent evidence have linked ANDRO with Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain leucine-rich-repeat containing receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome inhibition in a mouse model of intestinal inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In the present study, we chose the choline-deficient amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet to mimic human NASH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and studied the effects of ANDRO supplementation in this model. We found that ANDRO treatment ameliorates NASH development exercising and anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic action. In addition, we observed that ANDRO administration is associated with inflammasome inhibition, which is likely involved in the beneficial effects of this herbal compound in experimental NASH.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals and diets</title><p>All experiments followed guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and all procedures were approved by the local institutional animal care and use committee (Comit&#x000e9; de &#x000e9;tica y bienestar Animal, Escuela de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Cat&#x000f3;lica de Chile [CEBA] resolution # 13-016). All efforts were made to minimize animals suffering and to reduce the number of animals used. Male C57bl6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were aged 10 weeks at the beginning of this study and divided into four experimental groups (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;7&#x02013;10) receiving either CDAA diet (Catalog # 518753, Dyets Inc.

To date, effective pharmacologic agents and therapeutic approaches for this condition are limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In this context, the use of herbal compounds for the treatment of this disease has expanded in recent years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. However, scientific information on the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these natural compounds is scarce, which limits further therapeutic development of novel agents. In this study, we have demonstrated that ANDRO, a botanically-derived compound, exerts beneficial effects in a mouse model of NASH including attenuation of inflammation and fibrosis.</p><p>The anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of ANDRO in experimental NASH could be attributed to ANDRO modulatory effects of multiple signaling pathways in the liver. Among them ANDRO modulatory effects of NF-&#x003ba;B-related pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> may play a role since ANDRO suppressed NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activation in HepG2 cells transfected with a NF-&#x003ba;B2 luciferase reporter (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). NF-&#x003ba;B plays a key role in liver inflammation and hepatic immune response due to its influence in in different hepatic cell populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and the inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activation by ANDRO, through covalent modification of the p50 subunit of this transcription factor, has been described as a unique pharmacological mechanism explaining ANDRO&#x02019;s anti-inflammatory actions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In the present study, we clearly documented ANDRO modulation of inflammatory and fibrotic responses both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> and showed that ANDRO markedly influences NF-&#x003ba;B and inflammasome pathways in hepatocyte-derived cell lines thus supporting that ANDRO acts, at least in part, through its effects in these latter pathways. Also, given the attenuation of inflammatory responses in KC as well as modulation of fibrogenesis in HSCs and that has been shown that NF-&#x003ba;B critically influences the inflammatory response of KC, and survival and activation in HSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, it is likely that ANDRO exerts its action through this pathway. While these findings are correlative, they provide the foundational basis for future studies attempting to dissect specifically ANDRO&#x02019;s mechanism of action in NAFLD/NASH.</p><p>In the present study we also explored if ANDRO influences the expression of inflammasome components in experimental NASH. The inflammasome consists of an intracellular multi-protein complex that is formed upon exposure of a wide range of stimuli generated during liver injury and sterile inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), that belong to the pattern recognition receptors family, recognize damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) signals and promotes the assembly of inflammasome proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In turn, the inflammasome activates CASP1 that cleaves pro-IL-1&#x003b2; into the mature form of IL-1&#x003b2; determining amplification of liver inflammation and cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Growing evidence indicates that the NLRP3 inflammasome has an important role in inflammation and fibrosis in NASH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Of note, NLRP3 inflammasome components have been found to be markedly increased in the liver of NASH patients and also in experimental models of NASH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In addition, recent work by Wree <italic>et al</italic>. showed that constitutive expression of the active form of NLRP3 inflammasome is associated to extensive liver inflammation, hepatocyte cell death by pyroptosis and liver fibrosis in the same mouse model used by us<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In the present study we observed that ANDRO clearly reduced the expression of ASC and NLPR3 in CDAA-fed mice as well as decreased hepatic mRNA levels of CASP1 and IL-1&#x003b2; in this setting. Thus, ANDRO&#x02019;s modulatory effect on the inflammasome seems to be a novel effect of this botanical compound that deserves further study. Interestingly, two recent animal studies have found that beneficial effects of some natural compounds in experimental NASH are also related to modulation of the inflammasome in the liver. Thus, Vivoli <italic>et al</italic>. found that berberine, also an Ayurvedic medicine as ANDRO, interferes with activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and markedly improved parameters of liver injury and necro-inflammation in a mouse model of NASH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Also, Yang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> showed that NLRP3 inhibition by sulforaphane, a compound derived from cruciferous vegehtables, resulted in amelioration of hepatic steatosis in high-fat fed mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Both results are in agreement with our observations and suggest that reduced HTC, also observed by Ding <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and liver inflammation in ANDRO-treated mice fed with CDAA diet compared with vehicle-treated animals fed with the same diet may be related, at least in part, to modulation of hepatic inflammasome. Of note, since the CDAA diet feeding model is of more intense and long-term model of NASH, with all liver features of the disease compared to more &#x02018;metabolic&#x02019; models such as high-fat diet fed mice or short-term nutritional models such as methionine-choline-deficient diet-induced NASH, we were able to also document an anti-fibrotic action of ANDRO in the setting of NASH. Thus, ANDRO modulatory effect on the inflammasome seems to be a novel effect of this botanical compound that deserves further study.</p><p>Given the beneficial effects of ANDRO in our model of NASH we think that, after further studies replicating our findings, this compound could be tested in pilot clinical studies. Of note, ANDRO and ANDRO-related compounds have been tested in humans in short-term clinical trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> and inflammatory bowel disease with no relevant safety issues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Some potential limitations for the clinical use of ANDRO are related to its high insolubility, poor bioavailability, and short plasma half-life although efforts are being made to improve these shortcomings through modifying the molecule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> or complexing it with bigger compounds such as polyethyleneglycol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p>In summary, ANDRO administration attenuates liver damage in NASH reducing inflammation and fibrosis adding to the existent evidence of hepatoprotective effects of this botanical compound. Future work should focus on confirmation of ANDRO&#x02019;s effect in other NAFLD/NASH models, and the design of pilot clinical trials with ANDRO for patients with this increasingly important disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec22"><p>
