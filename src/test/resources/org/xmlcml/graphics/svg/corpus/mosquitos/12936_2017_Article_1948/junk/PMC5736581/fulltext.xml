Nevertheless, some aspects, such as the efficacy of vaccines, can be largely circumvented during natural coinfections. Sea lice are ectoparasitic copepods that can occur with a high prevalence in the field, are frequently found in co-infection with other pathogens, and are highly detrimental to fish health. The aim of this case-control study was to evaluate the interaction between the detrimental effects of coinfection and the protective effects of vaccination in fish. We used the interaction between the sea louse <italic>Caligus rogercresseyi</italic>, the bacterial pathogen <italic>Piscirickettsia salmonis</italic>, and their host, the Atlantic salmon <italic>Salmo salar</italic>, as a study model. Our results showed that coinfection decreased the accumulated survival (AS) and specific growth rate (SGR) of vaccinated fish (AS&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.6%; SGR&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.05&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.39%) compared to a single infection of <italic>P. salmonis</italic> (AS&#x02009;=&#x02009;42.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.3%; SGR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.21&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.22%). Concomitantly, the bacterial load and clinical signs of disease were significantly increased in coinfected fish. Coinfection may explain the reduced efficacy of vaccines in sea cages and highlights the need to test fish vaccines in more diverse conditions rather than with a single infection.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Coinfection has been reported in many different aquatic organisms, including salmonids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, cyprinids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, shrimps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and crabs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, the impact on host resistance against pathogens after a coinfection is not well understood. An initial pathogen infection can alter the host&#x02019;s immune response to subsequent infections by other pathogens by either suppressing or priming the immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Sea lice (Copepoda: Caligidae) have the greatest economic impact of any parasite on salmon farming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> because they typically injure the skin, a fundamental protective barrier of the fish, with their rasping mouthparts. This epithelial damage induces high levels of stress, loss of the physical and microbial protective function and a weakening of the immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Sea lice infection in salmon thus provides a highly relevant model to study coinfection since sea lice can weaken resistance to other pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Previously, Mustafa <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> reported an increase in susceptibility to <italic>Loma salmonae</italic>, a microsporidian parasite, when Atlantic salmon (<italic>Salmo salar</italic>) had been previously infected with the sea lice <italic>Lepeophtheirus salmonis</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Further, Bustos <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> suggested that a high level of coinfection between the sea lice <italic>Caligus rogercresseyi</italic> and the Amoeba <italic>Neoparamoeba perurans</italic> contributed to production losses during an outbreak of the pathogen, causing Amoebic gill disease in Chile. Moreover, Barker <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> found a significant reduction in the survival of Atlantic salmon infected with infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) when pre-infected with <italic>L. salmonis</italic>, compared to a single infection with ISAV.</p><p id="Par3">In Atlantic salmon, coinfection with the intracellular bacterium <italic>Piscirickettsia salmonis</italic> and the sea lice <italic>C. rogercresseyi</italic> has been recently studied both in farm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and in laboratory conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. <italic>P. salmonis</italic> is the causative agent of Piscirickettsiosis; this gram-negative intracellular bacterium has become a major problem for Chilean salmon farming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Mortalities of up to 90% have been reported, with annual losses to the Chilean industry reaching US$700 million<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. <italic>C. rogercresseyi</italic> has also caused substantial economic losses in Chilean salmon farming. This is due to negative effects on survival, growth and flesh quality, in addition to increased susceptibility to other infections and the cost of chemical treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In previous studies of coinfection with these pathogens, Gonzalez <italic>et al</italic>. (2016) showed significant increases in blood parameters, such as the haematocrit, plasma glucose and pCO<sub>2</sub> levels, in Atlantic salmon coinfected with <italic>C. rogercresseyi</italic> and <italic>P. salmonis</italic> in salt water conditions. They concluded that fish physiology could be altered considerably at a low parasite load, such as 4&#x02013;11 parasites per fish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Similarly, Lhorente <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> demonstrated that in Atlantic salmon reared under laboratory conditions, resistance to <italic>P. salmonis</italic> decreases significantly in non-vaccinated fish coinfected with sea lice <italic>C. rogercresseyi</italic>. Mortalities of 50% occurred after a single infection with <italic>P. salmonis</italic> compared to 100% mortality following coinfection with a medium or high load of <italic>C. rogercresseyi</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">High vaccination efficacy is an essential goal for the success of aquaculture and has been considered crucial in the global and large-scale salmon farming industry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In this industry, the use of vaccines against bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens that cause the most common fish diseases has expanded greatly in the last 10 years (see Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Nevertheless, some aspects such as the efficacy of vaccines in a natural coinfection process have been largely circumvented. Further, there is a consensus that the adaptive immunity in fish is weaker and of a transient nature compared with that of mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the interaction between the detrimental effects of coinfection of pathogens and the protective effects of vaccination in fish. As a study model, we used the interaction between the sea louse <italic>C. rogercresseyi</italic>, the bacterial pathogen <italic>P. salmonis</italic>, and the Atlantic salmon <italic>Salmo salar</italic> as the host.

For example, increased mortality has been demonstrated in goldfish <italic>Carassius auratus</italic> when exposed to a coinfection with the ectoparasite <italic>Dactylogyrus intermedius</italic> and the bacteria <italic>Flavobacterium columnare</italic> (Mortality&#x02009;=&#x02009;63.9%) compared to fish exposed only to the bacteria (Mortality 16.7%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Similarly, in the rainbow trout <italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>, an increase in mortality was observed when fish with <italic>Flavobacterium columnare</italic> were challenged by a secondary infection with the protozoan <italic>Argulus coregoni</italic>. The prevalence of parasitic sea lice can be as high as 100% in field conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, but its impact on fish health when coinfection occurs has received little attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Recently, Lhorente <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> reported that sea lice <italic>C. rogercresseyi</italic>, as a secondary pathogen, reduces the resistance of non-vaccinated Atlantic salmon to the pathogen <italic>P. salmonis</italic>. This study corroborates the detrimental effects of the coinfection of pathogens, showing that sea lice, as a primary pathogen, could decrease the resistance of fish against a bacterial infection. Importantly, the effects of coinfection of sea lice on fish that were previously vaccinated were examined in order to evaluate animals with vaccine amplified resistance against pathogens. Even with vaccination, coinfection with sea lice was detrimental to the fish, showing that the protective effects of vaccination were highly reduced.</p><p id="Par11">A decrease in Atlantic salmon resistance to <italic>P. salmonis</italic> due to coinfection with sea lice was also assessed on moribund fish using three sublethal indicators: growth, bacterial load and clinical signs of disease. Our study considered the evaluation of sublethal indicators when 50% of mortality was reached in each treatment, because that is usually considered the point at which the greatest variation in resistance/susceptibility among fish is expressed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. With regards to growth, it was known that sea lice could reduce appetite, food-conversion efficiency and growth in fish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Recently, it has been demonstrated that an infection with <italic>C. rogercresseyi</italic> is energetically demanding for Atlantic salmon, producing stress and disrupting fish physiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. The results presented here confirm such effects, showing that SGR of moribund fish was significantly lower in coinfected fish, compared to fish infected only with <italic>P. salmonis</italic>. Further, the possibility that coinfection modified the bacterial load on fish was investigated. The head kidney was selected for this, as it is considered a key organ for a host response analysis to <italic>P. salmonis</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. A high bacterial load in the head kidney has been associated with low resistance and high susceptibility of fish to infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. This analysis demonstrated an increased mortality by coinfection with <italic>C. rogercresseyi</italic> is associated with an increased presence of <italic>P. salmonis</italic> in the head kidney, compared with a single infection. Interestingly, there was no evidence that the bacterial load in the kidney was associated with the abundance of parasites on fish (see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Thus, it can be inferred that the impact of the parasites on bacterial load may occur at low parasite abundance. Previous studies showed that an abundance of 6 adult parasites per host (~120&#x02009;g) may induce relevant changes to the physiology of fish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Finally, the effect of coinfection on the clinical signs of <italic>P. salmonis</italic> infection was investigated and the results showed that five of six parameters evaluated were considerably altered in the coinfected fish. Ecchymosis can be almost exclusively attributed to a direct effect of skin infection with sea lice, while an increased diagnosis of melanomacrophages in the gills and white nodules in the liver can be considered a global response to coinfection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Absence of feed or digestion in the alimentary tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> and inflammation of the intestine were also commonly associated with clinical signs of <italic>P. salmonis</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Thus, all three of the measured sublethal indicators highlighted the increased vulnerability of vaccinated fish to bacterial infection when coinfected with sea lice. Additional studies are needed to validate whether these sublethal indicators are also altered in early stages of a coinfection process (e.g., the first days of infection and before mortality) and on fish surviving coinfection.</p><p id="Par12">In this study, differences of resistance were evaluated in two populations and compared between sexes. Differences in resistance against pathogens among populations and sexes have been observed in other studies on Atlantic salmon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Here, the two populations evaluated have a similar level of resistance to <italic>P. salmonis</italic>, however, better resistance in males than in females was observed. It is known that Atlantic salmon males and females differ genetically in several morphological and production traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Differences associated with early maturity of males may be ruled out as these fish were excluded during the vaccination process. The importance of sex-dependent resistance and its genetic basis needs to be investigated.</p><p id="Par13">To our knowledge, the interaction between the detrimental effect of coinfection and the protective effect of vaccination has not been previously evaluated in fish. Only, coinfections of multiple pathogens on a single host have been reported in different aquatic organisms. Nevertheless, the frequency at which this phenomenon occurs in aquatic systems, its impact at the population level, the consequences of the specific interaction by multiple pathogens on the health of the host and its modulation of the host immune system are not fully understood. Understanding each one of these elements is the main challenge in improving aquatic animal health and the welfare of farmed fish worldwide. Currently, billions of vaccine doses are being applied each year as a means of preventing outbreaks of bacterial and viral diseases in fish because vaccines have been shown to strengthen the immune systems of fish by increasing the adaptive immune response. This study has shown evidence that the ability of vaccinated fish to modulate a bacterial infection during coinfection with sea lice is strongly diminished, impeding fish recovery from infection. Coinfection by different pathogens may explain the reduced efficacy of vaccines in sea cages and highlights the need to test vaccines in more diverse conditions rather than a single infection. In particular, coinfection of key pathogens like sea lice should be tested when these pathogens are regularly present in the sea farm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p id="Par14">This study was carried out in accordance with the guide for the care and use of experimental animals of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.

During the salmon freshwater growth period, fish were vaccinated twice using commercial vaccines, following the strict protocols of the company.

The initial infections against <italic>P. salmonis</italic> were performed at 822 ATU (accumulated thermal units) within the immunization period described by the vaccine manufacturer. Vaccinated and unvaccinated fish from both populations were equally distributed in 4 6-m<sup>3</sup> tanks with 1444&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7 fish per tank, with two replicates for the single infection with <italic>P. salmonis</italic> and two replicates for the coinfection.

For the coinfection, sea lice were used as the primary pathogen, and <italic>P. salmonis</italic> was used as the secondary pathogen. A coinfection procedure was established based on our previous experience with this study model and trying to minimize any stress associated with fish density, water volume, oxygen and temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Briefly, infections with sea lice were performed by adding 60 copepodites per fish to each coinfection&#x02019;s tank. Copepodites were obtained from egg-bearing females reared in laboratory and confirmed as &#x0201c;pathogen free&#x0201d; (IPNV, ISAV, <italic>P. salmonis</italic> and <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic>) using RT-PCR diagnostic. After, water flow was stopped for 8&#x02009;h and tanks were covered to provide darkness, which favors a successful settlement of lice on fish. Fish density and water volume were not modified, oxygen was controlled to saturation and temperature was monitored with minimum variation during the procedure (&#x0003c;1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C). A placebo procedure was applied to single infection tanks, by maintaining them in darkness, and controlling fish density, water volume, temperature and oxygen levels equivalent to those that were measured in coinfected tanks. After 7 days of sea lice infestation, the secondary infection was performed with <italic>P. salmonis</italic>, and establishment of the parasites was confirmed and quantified on all fish. Since parasites were in a sessile stage (i.e. chalimus) and mostly adhered to the fins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, they were generally not be disturbed during these procedure. Further, fish were fasted for one day prior to each procedure to minimize the detrimental effects of stress on water quality parameters. Finally, to reduce stress during sampling, handling or vaccination fish were sedated with AQUI-S<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (50% Isoeugenol, 17&#x02009;mL/100&#x02009;L water).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Specific Growth Rate (SGR) and <italic>Piscirickettsia salmonis</italic> load</title><p id="Par18">Specific Growth Rate (SGR) and <italic>P. salmonis</italic> load were evaluated for individual moribund fish when 50% mortality was achieved in each treatment.

CT values from bacterial RNA as an indication of bacterial load was used for two reasons: 1) We obtained much better sensitivity by using RNA since it is present in higher copy number per bacteria than DNA, 2) Our fish were vaccinated, and often, bacterial DNA is present in the vaccines that are used. This would confound any DNA based analysis, and in fact, PCR over DNA is not recommended as a diagnostic method by the vaccine manufacturers.
