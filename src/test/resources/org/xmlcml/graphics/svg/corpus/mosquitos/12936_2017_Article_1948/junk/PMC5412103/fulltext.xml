A special formula provides the necessary nutrients found in protein without the phenylalanine. The diet is extremely restrictive and the formula has a strong taste and odor, which makes adherence to treatment extremely challenging <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>In a study of treatment adherence in 56 Brazilian PKU patients, in which adherence was defined by the median Phe concentration for a 12-month period, only 32.1% of the samples attained the targeted Phe levels: for children &#x0003c;&#x000a0;13&#x000a0;years this was &#x02264;&#x000a0;360&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L; for children &#x02265;&#x000a0;13&#x000a0;years, the target was &#x02264;&#x000a0;900&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Progressive deterioration in metabolic control has also been reported with age. Data from a survey of 10 European centers with a total of 1921 patients showed that at age one, the median blood Phe concentration was 175&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L; between 1 and 3&#x000a0;years, the median was 230&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L; between 4 and 10&#x000a0;years the median was 287&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L; between 11 and 16&#x000a0;years the median was 465&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L; and over 16&#x000a0;years the median was 777&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L. Also, the median percentage of blood samples meeting guidelines tended to diminish with age <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Similar results were reported by Meli and Bianca <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In this sample, blood Phe concentrations were greater than the recommended value in none of the patients younger than 1&#x000a0;year of age, in 8% of the 1- to 6-year-olds, 18% of the 6- to 10-year-olds, 40% of the 10- to 14-year-olds, and 70% of those older than 14&#x000a0;years.</p><p>When trying to understand how compliance to treatment changes in different stages of life, what the underlying causes are, and the impact of non-compliance to treatment in PKU, it must be understood that there is no agreement regarding which compliance measures are most important and how they should be defined. As Mac Donald <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> proposes, direct assessment of blood Phe concentration is perhaps the best overall measure, but there is still no consensus regarding the number of Phe concentrations that should be within target range over time and the frequency or timing of the measure. Also, most studies of compliance in PKU focus on short periods (12 to 24&#x000a0;months) and follow the same patients over longer periods of time.</p><p>In Chile, the prevalence is 1/18,916 births for PKU and 1/10,198 births for mild hyperphenylalaninemia (mHPA). Since 1992, Chile has had a national neonatal screening program for phenylketonuria that covers 99% of newborns. Children with classical PKU (Phe &#x02265;&#x000a0;20&#x000a0;mg/dL [1200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L]), mild PKU (Phe 6 to 19&#x000a0;mg/dL [360 to 1190&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L]) and also mHPA (Phe 2 to 6&#x000a0;mg/dL1[20 to 360&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L]) enter a follow-up program for hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) at the Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology (INTA), University of Chile national referral center. The follow-up program for children with PKU and mHPA includes regular measurements of Phe and tyrosine levels, as well as specialized assessments by a multidisciplinary team of pediatricians, nutritionists, neurologists, and psychologists. From diagnosis to adulthood multiple resources are used in patient education, from group workshops, written materials, individual/family education sessions, apps, among others.</p><p>Phe concentrations were both home monitored (samples taken at home and sent by mail) and monitored during clinical visits. Until 2010 the targeted blood Phe concentration of the Center was &#x0003c;&#x000a0;6&#x000a0;mg/dL during the first years of life and &#x0003c;&#x000a0;8&#x000a0;mg/dL (480&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L) for patients age 10&#x000a0;years or older. Currently, the targeted blood Phe concentrations are &#x02264;&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;mg/dL (240&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L) during the first year of life and &#x0003c;&#x000a0;6&#x000a0;mg/dL (360&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L) after that. Nutritional treatment should be maintained for life. All PKU patients from birth to age 24&#x000a0;years have access through government subsidy to Phe free formula at no charge.</p><p>The present study seeks to describe and understand how treatment compliance changes through infancy, childhood, and early adolescence in PKU patients. We also aim to identify early indicators of poor treatment compliance and risk of treatment discontinuation that could be addressed to prevent poor cognitive outcome in early-diagnosed patients.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Subjects and methods</title><p>This longitudinal, retrospective study included all children diagnosed through newborn screening in Chile between February 2001 and October 2008 (age 7&#x000a0;years to 13&#x000a0;years 11&#x000a0;months, median age: 11.4&#x000a0;years). Data on a total of 75 patients (33 females and 42 males) with a mean age of diagnosis confirmation of 15.8&#x000a0;days of life (range 2 to 45; SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;7.3) and average Phe blood concentration of 18.8&#x000a0;mg/dL (1138&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L) (range 6 to 38.5&#x000a0;mg/dL; SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;7.8) at diagnosis were analyzed. Treatment of all patients was initiated immediately after diagnostic confirmation. All included patients received a protein-restricted diet and had access to Phe-free formula at no cost, through government subsidy. No patients were receiving sapropterin treatment.</p><p>Yearly mean Phe concentration, number of blood samples sent, proportion of samples over the recommended range, and visits to the outpatient clinic were recorded for all patients. Given the relevance of early years on neurological development, data from the first year of life through age 4&#x000a0;years were analyzed separately in four groups, namely 0 to 11&#x000a0;months, 12 to 23&#x000a0;months, 24 to 35&#x000a0;months, and 36 to 48&#x000a0;months. Data from 4&#x000a0;years of age onward were analyzed in two-year periods, including 4 to 5&#x000a0;years and 11&#x000a0;months, 6&#x000a0;years to 7&#x000a0;years and 11&#x000a0;months, 8&#x000a0;years to 9&#x000a0;years and 11&#x000a0;months, 10&#x000a0;years to 11&#x000a0;years to 11&#x000a0;months, and 12&#x000a0;years to 12&#x000a0;years and 11&#x000a0;months.</p><p>Patients' treatment discontinuation was defined as no attendance to the outpatient clinic in a two-year period and no blood samples sent in a one-year period, both together.</p><p>Changes in the number of samples provided by the participants across the different assessment times were assessed with a repeated-measures ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrections were applied when sphericity assumptions were not met. Changes in blood Phe levels were assessed with a Friedman's ANOVA, since the variables were not normally distributed. Additional post hoc analyses were conducted using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with a Bonferroni correction applied.</p><p>A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to explore the prospective contribution of blood Phe levels measured across the participants&#x000b4; first to seventh year of age to blood Phe levels at 8&#x02013;10&#x000a0;years of age. Blood Phe levels measured at each assessment time were entered separately into the equation to control for the influence of earlier blood Phe levels. Results were tested against Bonferroni corrected p values.</p><p>The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to verify normal distribution of the data. Treatment adherence variables from individuals who did and did not discontinue treatment before 13&#x000a0;years of age were compared using Student's <italic>t</italic>-test. When normal distribution of a variable could not be proven, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used. Additionally, child development and cognitive performance between groups was compared by using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. It was hypothesized that the participants in the group who discontinued treatment before 13&#x000a0;years of age would have poorer treatment compliance as expressed in all the measured variables. Therefore, significance was tested against 1-tailed p values.</p><p>A series of independent logistic regression analyses were conducted to ascertain the effect of the above mentioned treatment adherence variables measured at each assessment time on the likelihood that participants would discontinue treatment before 13&#x000a0;years of age. The variables were entered into the equation using the Enter method. Data were analyzed using SPSS 21.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p>The results show a progressive increase in mean blood Phe concentrations with age.

Between 12 and 23&#x000a0;months of age, these patients had significantly higher mean Phe concentrations and proportions of samples over the recommended range.</p><p>During the second year of life, submitting a diminished number of blood samples might also be relevant. Overall, 64% of patients who had an insufficient number of blood samples sent (nine or fewer per year) between 12 and 23&#x000a0;months of age later discontinued treatment.</p><p>However, our models showed that when more than one variable was included in the analyses, we were able to more accurately predict which children would discontinue treatment. Indicators included number of samples, number of visits to outpatient clinic, as well as Phe levels and variability in metabolic control. By considering multiple indicators, we can better identify children and families who may need additional support, education, or counseling. In addition, this allows for the possibility of intervening early to increase treatment adherence before cognitive functioning is affected.</p><p>When analyzing the number of outpatient clinic visits, a limitation of the study was not including data on the location where the child lived. Location is relevant in this group since some of our most remote patients live &#x0003e;&#x000a0;1000&#x000a0;miles from the clinic. For this reason, nutritional counseling is frequently given by telephone. These data were not included in the analysis.</p><p>Despite this limitation, the information presented in this article has helped define a set of strategies implemented in our Center to promote treatment adherence in our young PKU patients. One strategy has been to focus on identifying early risk factors in the following areas: low parental degree of understanding or acceptance of the condition, insufficient number of blood samples sent, no request for blood sample results, elevated Phe blood concentration, insufficient Phe free formula intake, missing outpatient clinic visits and psychosocial risk factors.</p><p>When one or more of these areas are affected in infants and children, the patient is assigned to our high priority group. These cases are addressed in a monthly meeting where a physician, nutritionist, psychologist and social worker develop the most appropriate strategy to support the patient and his/her family. Cases of older children with very poor treatment compliance or who require social services protection due to severe parental neglect are also addressed in this way. In the upcoming years, we intend to report on the long-term impact of these strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>Mar&#x000ed;a Ignacia Garc&#x000ed;a declares that she has no conflict of interest.</p><p>Gabriela Araya declares that she has no conflict of interest.</p><p>Susan E Waisbren receives honorarium as consultant to Bio Marin Inc. doing scoring of neuropsychological tests.
