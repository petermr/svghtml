To better understand the colonization history and role that genetic diversity might have played in the founding and radiation of these new populations, we characterized ancestry and genetic diversity across latitude (39&#x02013;48&#x000b0;S). Samples from four distant basins in Chile were genotyped for 13 microsatellite loci, and allocated, through probabilistic mixture models, to 148 potential donor populations in North America representing 46 distinct genetic lineages. Patagonian Chinook salmon clearly had a diverse and heterogeneous ancestry. Lineages from the Lower Columbia River were introduced for salmon open-ocean ranching in the late 1970s and 1980s, and were prevalent south of 43&#x000b0;S. In the north, however, a diverse assembly of lineages was found, associated with net-pen aquaculture during the 1990s. Finally, we showed that possible lineage admixture in the introduced range can confound allocations inferred from mixture models, a caveat previously overlooked in studies of this kind. While we documented high genetic and lineage diversity in expanding Patagonian populations, the degree to which diversity drives adaptive potential remains unclear. Our new understanding of diversity across latitude will guide future research.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Multiple independent introduction events can lead to shifts in genetic variation relative to native source populations, potentially boosting invasiveness and potential for rapid local adaptation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Furthermore, different introduction vectors delivering distinct genetic lineages in different regions can result in a mosaic of populations with varying genetic diversity and evolutionary potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. We investigated self-sustaining Chinook salmon [<italic>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</italic> (Walbaum)] populations, currently part of a rapid colonization that is sweeping through Patagonia, the binational region of Chile and Argentina at the southern cone of South America. Specifically, we measured genetic diversity and evaluated the most likely phylogenetic origins of four self-sustaining populations spread over a wide geographical range that received multiple distinct introductions from different kinds of artificial propagation.</p><p id="Par3">Beginning in the 1870s, Chinook salmon, native to North America and the North Pacific Ocean, were deliberately introduced into innumerable rivers in all continents except Antarctica<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>; yet successful naturalization has been rare. Self-sustaining adfluvial (migrating between lake and river) Chinook salmon populations have been established in the North American Great Lakes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, but anadromous (migrating between the sea and river) populations outside their native range exist only in New Zealand&#x02019;s South Island and in Patagonia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The phylogenetic ancestry of New Zealand Chinook salmon was tracked to introductions in the early 1900s from the Sacramento River fall run (seasons characterize typical adult return to freshwater), most likely Battle Creek, California<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. When studied about 30 salmon generations later, a number of phenotypic traits had evolved apparently in response to local environmental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, offering increased local fitness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The monophyletic ancestry and known history of introduction in New Zealand greatly facilitated that research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. This rapid evolution in New Zealand underscores the potential of Chinook salmon to adapt to new environments, yet it begs the question of why successful introductions have been rare elsewhere.</p><p id="Par4">Patagonian Chinook salmon are much less studied than New Zealand Chinook salmon. Patagonian populations are younger than those in New Zealand but much more widespread. The ancestral origin of these populations is unclear, but out of the many introduction attempts beginning in the late 1800s, two relatively recent experimental commercial open-ocean ranching operations were most likely the sources of the introduced populations (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Self-sustaining populations occur in a vast region on western slopes south of 38&#x000b0;S draining through Chile and into the Pacific Ocean.

</p><p id="Par5">For the purpose of this study, we distinguish two classes of artificial propagation. In open-ocean ranching, returning adults are spawned artificially in fish hatcheries and the juveniles are released to grow at sea. These free-ranging fish may be harvested at sea but especially in a terminal fishery of maturing adults homing back to the stream of release. The second class is floating net-pen aquaculture. In this case, fish are held captive from hatching until harvest or reproduction (see below). One open-ocean ranching operation took place on Chilo&#x000e9; Island (42&#x000b0;S) during the period 1978&#x02013;1982 using primarily Cowlitz River Hatchery spring-run brood stock from the Lower Columbia River, Washington, U.S.A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The other open-ocean ranching operation took place further south in the Magellan region (51&#x000b0;S) during the period 1982&#x02013;1989 using University of Washington Hatchery fall-run broodstock, Puget Sound, Washington, as well as the progeny of adult fish returning to Chilo&#x000e9; Island<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">By 1988, Chilean salmonid propagation shifted entirely from open-ocean ranching to net-pen aquaculture in captivity. Despite the captive design, fish escaped in the thousands every year and many of those escapes were poorly documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The stocks utilized, also poorly documented, were relatively diverse, as ova importations came at least from Washington, Oregon, Vancouver Island, and from New Zealand (the latter with ancestry from the Sacramento River, Central Valley, California)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In contrast to open-ocean ranching, net-pen aquaculture was mostly concentrated in Chile&#x02019;s Lake District region (42&#x000b0;S)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Therefore, in contrast to New Zealand, Patagonian Chinook salmon represent a potentially polyphyletic assemblage, offering new and interesting research avenues to study colonization dynamics and contemporary evolution. A summary of Chinook salmon introductions to Patagonia is presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, and a complete review of introductions is provided as an online supplement (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">We analysed the genetic diversity and population structure of Chinook salmon in four western Patagonia basins. We then compared these to native North America populations, and finally estimated ancestry and lineage distribution in regions that differed in their history of artificial propagation by open-ocean ranching and net-pen aquaculture. For estimation of ancestry, we used two different classes of genetic mixture analysis, conditional maximum likelihood (CML) and model-based clustering (M-BC). We took advantage of a large, interagency, microsatellite baseline as our known-origin reference against which we compared fish from Patagonia. The international Genetic Analysis of Pacific Salmonids (GAPS) consortium assembled a comprehensive genetic baseline for coast-wide fishery management of mixed-stock fisheries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The accuracy and precision of mixture analysis using the GAPS baseline is substantial with either conditional or unconditional Bayesian methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> (for an assessment of the accuracy of the CML method, see Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), and mixture analysis provides a potentially useful approach for inferring the ancestry of Patagonian Chinook salmon. CML mixture analysis was used in two recent studies of the ancestry of Patagonian Chinook salmon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, as far as we know, the validity of this application in mixed-origin populations has not been demonstrated. Introduced populations violate the fundamental assumption of the model&#x02014;that individuals in the unknown sample actually originated from one of the baseline populations. Newly founded populations are isolated and expected to diverge from their ancestors through founder effects and genetic drift<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. An even greater concern is interbreeding of mixed-origin fish in the new range (admixture), producing novel genotypes not accurately attributable to any single source population. Founding effects and drift are not easily accounted for, but neither are they likely to fundamentally confound our analysis. When considering microsatellites or other neutral markers, it is unlikely that founding and drift would result in a Patagonian population looking more like an unrelated population than the true population of origin.

However, we also found interesting differences such as apparent contributions from undocumented introductions, and conversely, lack of evidence supporting the naturalization of well-documented introductions.</p><p id="Par25">Our study is distinguished from previous molecular studies of Patagonian Chinook salmon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> in three principal ways: (1) We used the most inclusive baseline dataset possible, including all potential North American donor lineages. Previous studies have been more or less limited by the number of reference lineages available for particular genetic markers. The GAPS microsatellite baseline is the most extensive of its kind and is ideally suited for this application. (2) To our knowledge, ours is the first study of its kind to take into account the potential for spurious allocation of admixed genotypes. Other studies have addressed genetic drift in introduced populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, but not admixture between divergent lineages. We suggest that admixture may be more problematic than genetic drift, and simulations of mixed-origin founding offered a cautionary note on potentially misleading results. Our observations are relevant to many studies that seek to characterize small genetic contributions from multiple founding lineages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. (3) Our study included naturalized populations both within and outside salmon aquaculture zones. This helped clarify the poorly documented role of net-pen aquaculture on Chinook salmon introduction to Chilean Patagonia. Thus, our study provides important new insight into the ancestry and history of colonization of Patagonian Chinook salmon.</p><p id="Par26">Mating structure is critical to our understanding of potential for adaptation and persistence of introduced lineages in Patagonia. Even though allele frequencies led us to pool within-river-basin samples into putative populations, we did find some evidence of heterozygote deficits including non-significant yet elevated <italic>F</italic>
<sub>IS</sub> values within basins. Recognizing limited power for detecting a Wahlund Effect, we also tried to draw inference from CML individual assignment probabilities. Fewer intermediate assignments (split probabilities between reference groups) were observed than expected for a (simulated) mixed-origin population at equilibrium. If real, such a result and the possibly low heterozygosity might indicate assortative mating of two or more genetically distinct lineages within a river basin. Alternatively, strong out-breeding depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> or insufficient time since introductions could result in fewer than expected mixed-origin and heterozygous individuals. A companion study to ours used the same Patagonian samples and an intensive genome scan of 11,759 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

<sub>IS</sub> in Patagonia. Resolution of these discrepancies and elucidation of specific population structure will require larger, and spatially stratified samples within and among river basins and across multiple generations.</p><p id="Par27">Our genetic CML mixture analyses strongly suggested a diverse array of founding lineages in Patagonia. Moreover, the number of founding lineages was clearly higher in northern Patagonia than in the south, and yet this latitudinal trend was uncorrelated with standard measures of genetic diversity. Overall, population genetic diversity measured by heterozygosity and allelic richness was higher than expected in Patagonia&#x02014;nearly identical to North American populations. Both of these surprising results were consistent with those from the companion SNP study of the same Patagonian populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Initially, we assumed high genetic diversity, i.e., heterozygosity and allelic richness, was a result of mixed ancestry. Previous studies have made similar conclusions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. CML mixture analysis and M-BC both estimated more founding lineages in the two northern Patagonian sites. Surprisingly, however, populations with the greatest number of founding lineages showed no higher levels of heterozygosity or allelic richness. Nor was there spatial structure for heterozygosity or allelic diversity, as was evident for lineage diversity. It would seem almost axiomatic that a diversity of founders would introduce more alleles relative to monophyletic populations, yet, as mentioned above, other factors might be confounding a clear association between lineage diversity and genetic diversity.</p><p id="Par28">A principal challenge in this study was to distinguish the genetic signal of true ancestry from the noise created by mixed-origin, introgressed populations. In our CML mixture analysis we expected some misassignments between related populations. The patterns of misassignment in the North American reference baseline (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) were well understood based on previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, our simulation of mixed-origin founding revealed some spurious genetic allocation not previously reported in studies that used this approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The CML simulation showed us that mixed origin (admixed) individuals usually assign to the true donors, however, some individuals will assign to unrelated populations, sometimes with high assignment probability. Note, however, that the probability values are conditional on available baseline references. A high assignment probability might simply mean that no other reference population could likely have produced a given genotype. This is relevant, for example, to studies that assume a probability threshold (e.g., 0.8) for accurate assignment, and especially to those with incomplete baseline datasets. While a probability threshold such as 0.8 is clearly useful in conventional genetic mixture applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, in a mixed-origin founding application, it is almost certainly the case that some high-probability individual assignments are attributable to the misassignment phenomenon that we demonstrated through simulation. Apparently, introgression between donor populations results in unique genotypes that assign arbitrarily to other, unrelated populations. To avoid falsely implicating potential donor lineages we set a lower threshold for genetic contribution below which putative ancestry was viewed with caution and some skepticism. Based on review of both simulated and empirical data, we used a threshold of 10% estimated genetic contribution to any single population in Patagonia. It was not that we rejected as potential contributors lineages below 10%, rather we were less confident in identifying those as founders.</p><p id="Par29">Despite this caveat, our findings clearly confirm the importance of entrepreneurial attempts to establish Chinook salmon open-ocean ranching programs in Chile during the late 1970s and 1980s.

In 1978 Domsea Pesquera Chile Ltda. (a subsidiary of Union Carbide Corporation, USA) began yearly stockings of Chinook salmon in a small stream on Quinchao Island, Curaco de V&#x000e9;lez, Chilo&#x000e9; (42&#x000b0;S).

The finding of the Interior Columbia River summer/fall lineage in our samples probably reflects the introduced Bonneville Hatchery fall-run. By contrast, there is little evidence of successful University of Washington Hatchery fall-run (see below).</p><p id="Par30">Subsequent open-ocean ranching experiments in the Magellan region (51&#x000b0;S) utilized the University of Washington Hatchery fall-run stock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.

Moreover, all University of Washington Hatchery fish assign correctly to the South Puget Sound fall run lineage (i.e., no misassignments to West Cascade spring nor to any other population outside South Puget Sound). Further study is obviously needed in the Magellan region where the University of Washington Hatchery brood stock was introduced.</p><p id="Par32">Patagonian Chinook salmon unrelated to the West Cascade spring and fall lineages (hereafter non-WC) accounted for almost half of the fish (45.8%), mostly taken from north of parallel 45&#x000b0;S. The phylogenetic origins of non-WC fish were tracked to 14 diverse and geographically widespread lineages in North America. This seemingly hyperdiverse assemblage is at least partly explained by spurious individual assignments, especially those related to mixed ancestry (consistent with our simulations). However, much of this diversity appears due to accidental escapes from thriving Chilean net-pen salmonid aquaculture operations in the 1990s that imported ova from diverse sources.</p><p id="Par33">Since 1988, Chilean artificial production shifted entirely from ocean ranging to net-pen aquaculture. Although substantial escapes were frequent, they were hard to quantify because they commonly went unreported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Data gathered from insurance companies alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> led to an estimate of one million salmon and trout escaping every year, primarily from net-pen aquaculture. Although Chinook salmon farming has always been marginal in Chile relative to other species (&#x0003c;4,000 tons y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and &#x0003c;2.5% y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of total salmonid production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>), sustained Chinook salmon farming in leaky rearing facilities certainly contributed propagules to the wild<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. We estimate that with one million escaped salmon and trout per year, adjusting for the contribution of Chinook salmon to annual harvest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, <italic>c</italic>. 100,000 farmed sub-adult Chinook salmon might have escaped between the onset of modern salmonid farming (1988) and the date of our sampling (early 2004). During this period, numerous aquaculture companies were established in Chile, propagating Chinook salmon brood stocks to meet increasing demand. Aedo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> assembled the fragmentary record of importations and concluded that ova originated at least from Washington, Oregon, Vancouver Island, and New Zealand (of Central Valley ancestry), but specific stocks mostly went undocumented (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par34">Although sparse, this information could explain the incidence of Patagonian genotypes related to multiple lineages of the West Coast of U.S.A. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of non-WC fish was concentrated in the north (Tolt&#x000e9;n and Petrohu&#x000e9;), consistent with more intensive propagule pressure of distinct lineages farmed in this region. In fact, during the 1990s, most aquaculture activity (and escapes) was concentrated in the Lakes District region (41&#x02013;43&#x000b0;S), within 200&#x02009;km of the Petrohu&#x000e9; River. Tolt&#x000e9;n River (39&#x000b0;S), being a few hundred kilometres further north, might have received colonists dispersing naturally from the Lake District region, escapees from inland hatcheries, or deliberate stockings. Both Tolt&#x000e9;n and Petrohu&#x000e9; are located in well-populated regions easily accessible by paved roads. In sharp contrast, our more remote southern study sites (45&#x02013;50&#x000b0;S) experienced only incipient aquaculture activity (Ays&#x000e9;n River) or none at all (Baker River). Here, accidental escapes or unreported deliberate stockings were less likely, and natural dispersion alone seems the most likely source of founders, especially in the remote and isolated Baker River basin. Other studies have come to similar conclusions by comparing one Chinook salmon population in the Pacific slope of Patagonia (Futaleuf&#x000fa; River, 43&#x000b0;S<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>) to another population in the Atlantic slope (Santa Cruz River, 50&#x000b0;S<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>). The population closer to the Lake District region (Pacific slope) showed affinity to more lineages than the population in the Atlantic slope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Thus, escapes from net-pen aquaculture activity in the Lake District region have augmented the genetic diversity initially introduced by open-ocean ranching operations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, <sup>this study</sup>. Similarly, the introgression of cultured rainbow trout genes into pre-existing, naturalized, rainbow trout populations in Patagonia, has also been demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par35">An apparent lack of Central Valley ancestry was similar to the findings of one previous molecular study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> but different to another<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. It is worth noting that previous studies like ours did not account for potential spurious assignments of mixed-origin fish to unrelated reporting groups. Thus, numerous additional sources were identified as putative contributing lineages. We do not refute the presence of these additional lineages. We simply recognize the limitation we discovered in our genetic mixture analysis regarding mixed-origin fish, and we focus on what we take to be the major lineages that became established at our study sites (those lineages receiving &#x02265;10% allocation).</p><p id="Par36">Notable patterns of lineage distribution are emerging at a continental scale. Northern study sites (Tolt&#x000e9;n and Petrohu&#x000e9;) showed unexpectedly high lineage diversity, including substantial estimated contributions from five or more lineages (North Oregon Coast, West Cascade spring, South Puget Sound fall, Whidbey Basin, and Interior Columbia River summer/fall). By contrast, southern study sites (Ays&#x000e9;n and Baker) revealed a striking dominance of three closely related lineages from the Lower Columbia River (i.e., West Cascade spring, West Cascade fall and Willamette spring lineages). Similar diversity was also found in the Santa Cruz River draining to the Atlantic Ocean in Argentinian Patagonia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. A number of possibilities could explain this interesting pattern: (1) As discussed above, higher propagule pressure of distinct lineages escaping from fish farms might have resulted in higher lineage diversity in northern sites compared to remote southern localities that lacked farms (propagule pressure hypothesis). (2) Most dispersing colonists moved northwards in our study area such that those colonizing Ays&#x000e9;n and Baker rivers were derived from stockings in the Magellan region of West Cascade spring and fall ancestry, whereas those colonizing Petrohu&#x000e9; and Tolt&#x000e9;n rivers were derived from fish farms in the Lake District region (propagule+dispersion hypothesis). This pattern would resemble natural ocean migration patterns of Washington and Oregon stocks towards the north in the North Pacific, although it is unclear how the fish would respond to magnetic stimuli of the southern hemisphere. (3) Deliberate stockings initiated the first wave of invasion that eventually reached Ays&#x000e9;n and Baker rivers, either from the north or south. Previous establishment of West Cascade spring and&#x000a0;fall lineages might have inhibited the expansion of farmed lineages from the north (density-dependent hypothesis). At present, it is hard to gauge the relative importance of these processes, and it is conceivable that each contributed to the observed pattern of lineage distribution.</p><p id="Par37">Complex invasion dynamics and distinct patterns of genetic diversity are likely to have profound evolutionary consequences in the continuing range expansion of Chinook salmon in Patagonia. High genetic diversity, as measured by high allelic and lineage richness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, <sup>this study</sup>, high phenotypic plasticity and rapid adaptive evolution observed in Chinook salmon introduced to New Zealand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, as well as adaptation to environmental conditions inferred for Patagonian populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, are all features that suggest high adaptive potential of Chinook salmon in Patagonia. Lower-than-expected levels of heterozygosity, if confirmed and maintained over generations, could indicate reproductive isolation between sympatric lineages, which would help maintain lineage identity. Whether this happens is crucial to the evolutionary trajectory of the species in its new range. Lineages could either evolve adapting genetically to local conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> or they could interbreed and recombine, potentially resulting in new phenotypic variation with unpredictable evolutionary outcomes. Chinook salmon may exert strong ecological impacts in freshwater, estuarine and marine ecosystems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, and different evolutionary outcomes will directly affect these impacts owing to considerable phenotypic variation among lineages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Field collection</title><p id="Par38">Chinook salmon populations were sampled in the fall of 2004 from rivers in the four Andean basins of Tolt&#x000e9;n, Petrohu&#x000e9;, Ays&#x000e9;n and Baker (39&#x02013;48&#x000b0;S), all draining to the South Pacific through Chile (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Specifically, we used a slight modification of the dataset analysed by Moran <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. We added the following populations because they were identified previously as potential sources of Patagonian Chinook salmon (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>): Cowlitz River spring and fall-run, and Green River fall-run from the West Cascade spring and fall-run reporting groups, and University of Washington Hatchery fall-run population from the South Puget Sound fall-run reporting group.

Results were subsequently aggregated by reporting group (genetic lineage), which is the level of inference in essentially all our interpretations. The mean probability across individuals for membership to a particular lineage was taken as an approximation of overall genetic ancestral contribution to the population (normally interpreted as the unbiased estimate of that population&#x02019;s contribution to, e.g., a mixed-stock fishery). Simulation studies helped us evaluate the strength of those assumptions under conditions of mixed ancestry. The CML analysis was used as a first approximation to help narrow the range of contributing lineages to just the major contributors. A reduced set of populations and lineages was then further analysed by M-BC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Simulated mixed-origin founding</title><p id="Par42">Despite the common use of CML for studies of ancestry of non-native populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, its validity in that application has not to our knowledge been demonstrated. As a test of the algorithm&#x02019;s sensitivity to the presence of mixed-origin founding, we simulated a new population derived from large and equal numbers of individuals from two of our North American baseline populations. These were specific populations that appeared to be associated with the introduction to Patagonia (Cowlitz River Hatchery spring-run population in the West Cascade spring-run lineage and Soos Creek Hatchery fall-run population in the South Puget Sound fall-run lineage). That simulated founding involved the creation of an ideal population (at mutation/drift equilibrium) with intermediate allele frequencies to the Cowlitz River and Puget Sound source populations. We then drew 1000 individuals from that new, mixed-origin population, and we estimated the posterior probability distributions for those simulated individuals, the same as we did for the real Patagonian fish. We sought to determine whether the admixed genotypes would assign with high probability to one or the other source population, or split their probability of assignment between the two source populations. These novel genotypes might even assign to other, unrelated populations in the large coast-wide North American baseline (where &#x0201c;assignment&#x0201d; simply reflects the maximum <italic>a posteriori</italic> probability of membership to population or reporting group).
