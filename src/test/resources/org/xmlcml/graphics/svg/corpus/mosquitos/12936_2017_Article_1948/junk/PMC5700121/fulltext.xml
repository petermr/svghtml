The global prevalence of diabetes has nearly doubled since 1980, rising from 4.7% to 8.5%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The main goal in treatment of diabetes is the control of the blood glucose level. This goal can be achieved with the injections of insulin in case of type 1 diabetes. However, the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is more complicated due to insulin resistance. The following types of drugs are used in the current clinical practice for the treatment of T2DM: insulin release increasing drugs (sulfonyl ureas), biguanides, in which the mechanism of action is not clear yet, nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b3; agonists (e.g., thiazolidinediones), &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, insulin secretagogues (injectable incretin analogues), and sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. If not controlled, diabetes may be associated to cognitive dysfunction, dementia and systemic metabolic syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Glucokinase (GK) or hexokinase IV/D is one of the promising targets for glucose-lowering agents. This enzyme facilitates the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate that is the first step both in glycolysis and glycogen synthesis. GK has molecular weight of 50&#x02009;kDa and is mainly expressed in liver and pancreas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. GK activity can be enhanced by small molecules binding to its allosteric site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and the development of GK activators (GKAs) is now considered as one of the most promising strategies for T2DM treatment. Several GKAs reached phase II clinical trials. Among them are <bold>Piragliatin</bold>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, <bold>AMG-151</bold> (<bold>ARRY-403</bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, <bold>PF-04937319</bold>

Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. However, despite extensive studies in this area for the last 15 years, there are currently no GK activators that reached the market. The known GK activators have a number of side effects, such as narrow therapeutic window and concerns regarding potential effects on lipid metabolism, which strongly limit their potential utility and explain the reasons for failure in clinical trials. Therefore, the design and discovery of novel chemotypes of GKAs which do not possess such disadvantages is of a great interest for the pharmaceutical industry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In the framework of our GKAs discovery strategy based on screening of diverse chemical libraries, we have performed a virtual screening procedure using a molecular docking approach. The obtained <italic>in silico</italic> hits were then screened in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. As a result, we have obtained a series of active compounds reported in this paper.

<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> (Suppl. Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), a potent GK activator that had been developed in phase II clinical studies at Pfizer for the oral treatment of type 2 diabetes (discontinued in 2015), was used as a positive control. All the studied compounds appeared to be potent GK activators (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The nature of the linking sulfur-containing group significantly influenced the activity level. Thus, the GK activation rates by compounds <bold>5</bold> and <bold>6</bold> at 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;M (~150% and 130%, respectively) were comparable to that of the reference drug (~154%) at the same concentration.

The 50% effective concentrations of the leading compounds <bold>5</bold> and <bold>6</bold> (18.6 and 33.4&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) were approx. 3&#x02013;5 times higher than EC<sub>50</sub> of <bold>PF-04937319</bold>. It is interesting and practically important to understand possible reasons for the increased activity of sulfide <bold>5</bold> in comparison with its oxidized derivatives <bold>7</bold> and <bold>8</bold>. Analysis of <sup>1</sup>H NMR data reveals strong intramolecular interactions between the linker SO (or SO<sub>2</sub>) groups and the hydroxymethyl groups in position 5 of the pyridoxine ring. Thus, a splitted signal is observed corresponding to H<sub>a</sub> and H<sub>b</sub> protons of the 5-hydroxymethyl group in <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of sulfoxide <bold>7</bold>; at the same time, such a splitting is not found in <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of sulfide <bold>5</bold>. This effect can be explained by a hindered rotation of the 5-hydroxymethyl group around the C<sub>Ar</sub>&#x02013;C(OH) bond that can stabilize molecular conformations which are not optimal for effective binding.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Effect of studied compounds on GK activity and the docking energies of new compounds in the GK allosteric site.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">
