The concomitant activation of kappa opioid receptors (KOR) potentiates these features, pointing to a functional crosstalk between D2R and KOR. The results showed that less dopamine in the nucleus accumbens of the brain is associated with locomotor sensitization. D2R function is enhanced by KOR coactivation and anatomic data indicate that the crosstalk occurs presynaptically in dopamine terminals and postsynaptically in a subpopulation of efferent neurons of the nucleus accumbens. These data help to understand how alterations in dopamine neurotransmission underlie behavioral impairments.</p></sec></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dopamine mesolimbic circuit connecting the ventral tegmental area (VTA) with the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key modulator of goal-directed behaviors. Dopamine and glutamate terminals synapse on 2 populations of efferent GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the NAc (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Sesack and Pickel, 1990</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). One MSN population, the direct pathway, expresses preferentially D1 receptors and the other, the indirect pathway, D2 receptors (D2Rs) (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Bertran-Gonzalez et al., 2008</xref>). The integration of incoming neurochemical signals on MSN controls goal-directed behaviors (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Goto and Grace, 2008</xref>). Imbalances of dopamine neurotransmission modify goal-direct behaviors, and its chronic impairment underlies several neuropsychiatric diseases. In this regard, repeated administration of psychostimulants, which increase extracellular dopamine in the NAc, results in locomotor sensitization and compulsive motivation for the abused drug (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Pierce and Kalivas, 1997</xref>). Interestingly, the repeated activation of only D2R is sufficient to induce locomotor sensitization and compulsive behaviors (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Szechtman et al., 1993</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Triana del Rio et al., 2011</xref>), being suggested as an animal model for obsessive-compulsive disorder (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Dvorkin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Stuchlik et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>D2R-induced locomotor sensitization is accelerated and potentiated by the concomitant administration of kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonists (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Perreault et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2007a</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2007b</xref>). The fact that KOR activation increases locomotor sensitization and compulsive behaviors is surprising given the bulk of data pointing to KOR limiting the reinforcing properties of drugs of abuse. However, increasing information supports the idea that chronic activation of KOR would rather have effects that go in the same direction as that of drugs of abuse, contributing to enhance sensitized behaviors (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Wee and Koob, 2010</xref>). Anatomical and molecular bases of KOR enhancing D2R-induced sensitization are unknown. We hypothesize that KOR coactivation enhances the neuroplastic changes underlying D2R-induced locomotor sensitization. Our goals were to study the colocalization of KOR and D2R at pre- and postsynaptic levels in the NAc and the neurochemical modifications that accompany KOR enhancement of D2R-induced locomotor sensitization. Currently, it is known that D2R are present presynaptically in glutamate and dopamine terminals in the NAc and postsynaptically on dendritic spines of MSN (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Sesack et al., 1994</xref>). The acute activation of presynaptic D2R inhibits dopamine release and locomotor activity. However, high doses of agonists stimulate postsynaptic D2R inducing locomotor activity by inhibiting the indirect pathway. We and others have shown that the locomotor sensitization induced by the repeated activation of postsynaptic D2R is associated with a significant reduction of extracellular dopamine in the NAc (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Koeltzow et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Escobar et al., 2015</xref>). Like D2R, acute KOR activation decreases extracellular dopamine in the NAc and locomotor activity (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Di Chiara and Imperato, 1988</xref>), and KOR knockout mice have increased extracellular dopamine (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Chefer et al., 2005</xref>), indicating that KOR tonically inhibits dopamine release. Supporting a direct role regulating dopamine extracellular levels in the NAc, electronic microscopy data showed that KOR are present on dopamine terminals in this nucleus (<xref rid="CIT0029a" ref-type="bibr">Svingos et al., 2001</xref>). Also, electrophysiological studies indicate that the soma of dopamine neurons projecting to the NAc lack KOR (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Margolis et al., 2006</xref>). Increasing data suggest a functional crosstalk between KOR and D2R regulating dopamine in the NAc. For instance, the repeated activation of KOR decreases D2R presynaptic inhibitory control over stimulated dopamine release in the NAc (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Acri et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Fuentealba et al., 2006</xref>). A molecular explanation of these data relates the repeated activation of KOR to a reduction of D2R (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Izenwasser et al., 1998</xref>). However, repeated concomitant activation of KOR and D2R increases the number of D2R in the high-affinity state (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Perreault et al., 2007b</xref>). Altogether, the data suggest a crosstalk between KOR and D2R regulating dopamine release and locomotor activity. However, there is no anatomical information regarding KOR and D2R colocalization and their functional crosstalk in the mesolimbic system that could explain KOR potentiation of D2R-induced locomotor sensitization.</p><p>Here, we assessed the presynaptic control of tonic and phasic dopamine release in the NAc in rats repeatedly co-treated with KOR and D2R agonists and determined KOR and D2R colocalization at pre- and postsynaptic levels in the NAc. Our results show that chronic coactivation of KOR enhances D2R-induced sensitization. In this way, KOR directly enhances D2R inhibition of dopamine release in the NAc, an effect supported by anatomical data showing their colocalization on the same dopamine terminals. The anatomical data also show postsynaptic colocalization of KOR and D2R on a subpopulation of MSN, suggesting that KOR potentiation of D2R-induced locomotor sensitization arises by a postsynaptic crosstalk between these receptors in the indirect efferent pathway of the NAc.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Animals</title><p>Male Sprague-Dawley rats (270&#x02013;300 g) were obtained from the animal care facility of the Faculty of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences of Universidad de Chile.

Rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (Stoelting). Anesthesia was maintained by supplemental administration of chloral hydrate as required to maintain the suppression of limb compression withdrawal reflex. Body temperature was maintained by keeping the animals over a controlled heating pad. Microdialysis was carried out as previously described (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Escobar et al., 2015</xref>). A microdialysis probe 2 mm long (CMA 11; CMA Microdialysis AB) was placed primarily into the NAc core by using the following coordinates relative to Bregma: A.P.: +1.2 to 1.5 mm; M.L.: 1.4 mm; D.V.: 7.4 mm. The microdialysis probe was continuously perfused with Krebs solution at a flow rate of 2 &#x000b5;L/min, and samples were taken every 10 minutes. After 3 baseline levels were taken and to test the effect of KOR activation, U69593 (0.3 mg/kg) was injected 30 min before QNP (0.5 mg/kg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

A working electrode (glassy-carbon microelectrode) was dropped down into the NAc core by using the following coordinates AP: +1.3 to 1.5 mm; ML: 1.3 mm; DV: 6.5 mm. A stimulating electrode (Plastics One) was lowered into the VTA with the following coordinates AP: -5.2 mm; ML: 1.1 mm; DV: 7.5 mm. Electrical stimulation was delivered every 5 minutes; 3 baseline collections were conducted, and U69593 (0.15 mg/kg i.v.) or vehicle was injected.

Rats were injected (9th injection) with the same drugs that they received during repeated protocol while microdialysis samples of the NAc were taken. To discriminate between KOR and D2R inhibitory action, U69593 was injected first, followed 30 minutes later by QNP injection. A within-subjects 2-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of treatment group (F<sub>3,38</sub>= 11.65, <italic>P</italic>=.0001), time (F<sub>2,38</sub> = 44.83, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.0001), and interaction (F<sub>6,38</sub> = 6.74, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.0001).

The magnitude of the inhibitory action of U69593 and QNP in na&#x000ef;ve rats is similar to that found for rats repeatedly treated with the drugs (supplementary Figure 1). A 70-mM K<sup>+</sup> stimulus was used to assess KOR and D2R presynaptic inhibitory function during depolarization. A 2-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of time (F<sub>5,112</sub> = 67.31, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.0001), treatment (F<sub>3,112</sub> = 9.28, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.0001), and interaction (F<sub>15,112</sub>=5.26, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.0001).

Our neurochemical data show that decreased extracellular dopamine levels in the NAc are associated with D2R sensitization, and KOR coactivation accelerates the inhibitory action of D2R autoreceptors. Anatomically, we found that the highest KOR and D2R presynaptic colocalization occurs in the same dopamine terminals, supporting a role for KOR in regulating D2R presynaptic function in the NAc. Also, we found high postsynaptic localization of KOR in D2R-positive MSN cell bodies of the NAc, supporting a role of KOR potentiating D2R inhibition of the indirect pathway.</p><p>D2R-induced locomotor sensitization, defined as an increased response to the same stimulus, has pre- and postsynaptic components. On one hand, we and others have shown a significant decrease of synaptic dopamine in the NAc after repeated QNP treatment (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Koeltzow et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Escobar et al., 2015</xref>). In fact, QNP-sensitized rats show decreased burst activity of VTA dopamine neurons, which may explain less synaptic dopamine in the NAc (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Sesia et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, less dopamine induces supersensitivity of dopaminergic receptors, leading to an overinhibition of the indirect pathway of motor control with each QNP challenge. Which of these components is accelerated and potentiated with the concomitant activation of KOR receptors?</p><p>Initially, we tested the hypothesis that KOR endogenous activity could underlie locomotor sensitization induced by repeated stimulation of D2R. The results showed that KOR blockade did not prevent enhancement in horizontal locomotion induced by QNP, indicating that endogenous KOR signaling does not mediate the induction of locomotor sensitization by repeated D2R activation. Consistent with this finding, no increase in the endogenous KOR agonist, dynorphin, was observed after repeated D2R activation (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Engber et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Perreault et al., 2007a</xref>).</p><p>We then tested the hypothesis that KORs have an immediate effect enhancing locomotor sensitization induced by repeated activation of D2R. Indeed, it was reported that enhancement of QNP-induced locomotor activity starts from the first co-injection with U69593 (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Perreault et al., 2006</xref>), which suggested that the KOR effect enhancing QNP-induced locomotor sensitization does not require time to develop. Two pieces of data showed that this is not the case. First, our behavioral data showed that the KOR effect is not immediate. Horizontal locomotor activity was significantly greater by the fourth injection in rats treated with U69-QNP compared with control rats. Second, no differences were found on QNP-induced locomotor activity in QNP-sensitized rats acutely injected with U69593 or vehicle. These observations indicate that KOR-dependent potentiation of QNP-sensitized locomotion requires repeated KOR coactivation.</p><p>Our behavioral and neurochemical data indicate that KOR enhancement of D2R-induced locomotor sensitization involves both pre- and postsynaptic components. To obtain a neuroanatomical substrate for the functional presynaptic interaction between KOR and D2R, we studied whether KOR and D2R are colocalized in dopamine terminals of the NAc. We found that the highest colocalization of D2R and KOR in the NAc was in synaptosomes containing TH, supporting a role of KOR regulating D2R autoreceptor function. FSCV data showed that KOR acceleration of QNP-induced locomotor sensitization is accompanied by faster inhibitory response of presynaptic D2R decreasing electrically evoked dopamine release. In conclusion, the data indicate that the acceleration of D2R-dependent locomotor sensitization induced by KOR coactivation is due to its presynaptic action reinforcing the decrement of phasic dopamine release.</p><p>The effect of KOR potentiating D2R-dependent locomotor sensitization, that is, reaching more locomotor activity, can have 2 possible explanations: recruiting more MSN efferent cells of the indirect pathway or enhancing postsynaptic D2R action on these same neurons. We reject that KOR coactivation increases postsynaptic D2R sensitization, since steady-state extracellular dopamine levels in the NAc were reduced to the same extent in U69-QNP and Veh-QNP. Therefore, to further investigate the mechanism underlying KOR potentiation of D2R-dependent locomotor sensitization, we studied colocalization of these receptors postsynaptically in the NAc. As expected, D2R is localized in some MSN cell bodies of striatum and NAc. Unexpectedly, we found large KOR-like immunolabeling in postsynaptic MSN cell bodies of the NAc. More important and supporting a role of KOR potentiating D2R-induced locomotor sensitization, a subpopulation of MSN of the NAc was positive for both KOR and D2R. It is worth mentioning that immunofluorescent assays were performed in mice instead of rats to have better quality anatomical data. Even though it is possible that the distribution of the receptors could be different in both species, behavioral and neurochemical studies indicate that mice and rats share molecular mechanisms regarding locomotor sensitization. For instance, similar to rats, mice develop locomotor sensitization induced by drugs of abuse and QNP (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2010</xref>), and D2R and KOR activation decrease dopamine release in the NAc (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Ehrich et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, we propose that potentiation of D2R-dependent sensitization by KOR coactivation is due to stabilizing D2R inhibitory action on efferent MSN of the NAc. However, we cannot exclude that dorsal striatum or other brain nuclei play important roles in KOR enhancing D2R-induced compulsive behaviors. Indeed, KOR and D2R have a similar role regulating dopamine neurotransmission in dorsal striatum and locate presinaptically in dopamine terminals and postsynaptically in MSN (data not shown), where they can also interact. Further studies are required to test the role of dorsal striatum in KOR enhancing D2R-mediated sensitization.</p><p>In conclusion, the diminution of the extracellular levels of dopamine and consequently the sensitization of the D2R seem to be key elements in the maintenance of compulsive behaviors. Our data show that repeated coactivation of KOR potentiates D2R-induced locomotor sensitization by increasing the efficacy of D2R pre- and postsynaptic inhibitory action, suggesting that repeated activation of KOR stabilizes D2R in the plasmatic membrane or the coupling to secondary messenger system. Increasing data show that KOR activation enhances motivation for drugs of abuse and mediates the effect of stress associated with chronic abuse of drugs (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Koob et al., 2014</xref>). Our data provide a mechanism by which KOR modifies the action of D2R that could be the basis of lasting changes observed in compulsive behaviors.</p></sec><sec><title>Statement of Interest</title><p>None.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary_Figure_S1</label><media xlink:href="pyx042_suppl_Supplementary_Figure_S1.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient&#x000ed;fico y Tecnol&#x000f3;gico (grants 1110352, 1150200 to M.E.A.).
