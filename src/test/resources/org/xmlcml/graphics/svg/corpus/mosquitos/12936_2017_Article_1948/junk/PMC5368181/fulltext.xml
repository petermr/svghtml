In the gastric epithelium, the bacterium modifies many signaling pathways, resulting in contradictory responses that favor both proliferation and apoptosis. Consistent with such observations, <italic>H. pylori</italic> activates routes associated with cell cycle progression and cell cycle arrest. <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection also induces the hypoxia-induced factor HIF-1&#x003b1;, a transcription factor known to promote expression of genes that permit metabolic adaptation to the hypoxic environment in tumors and angiogenesis. Recently, however, also roles for HIF-1&#x003b1; in the repair of damaged DNA and inhibition of gene expression were described. Here, we investigated signaling pathways induced by <italic>H. pylori</italic> in gastric cells that favor HIF-1&#x003b1; expression and the consequences thereof in infected cells. Our results revealed that <italic>H. pylori</italic> promoted PI3K/mTOR-dependent HIF-1&#x003b1; induction, HIF-1&#x003b1; translocation to the nucleus, and activity as a transcription factor as evidenced using a reporter assay. Surprisingly, however, transcription of known HIF-1&#x003b1; effector genes evaluated by qPCR analysis, revealed either no change (LDHA and GAPDH), statistically insignificant increases SLC2A1 (GLUT-1) or greatly enhance transcription (VEGFA), but in an HIF-1&#x003b1;-independent manner, as quantified by PCR analysis in cells with shRNA-mediated silencing of HIF-1&#x003b1;. Instead, HIF-1&#x003b1; knockdown facilitated G1/S progression and increased Cyclin D1 protein half-life, via a post-translational pathway. Taken together, these findings link <italic>H. pylori</italic>-induced PI3K-mTOR activation to HIF-1&#x003b1; induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest by a Cyclin D1-dependent mechanism. Thus, HIF-1&#x003b1; is identified here as a mediator between survival and cell cycle arrest signaling activated by <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic></kwd><kwd>PI3K/mTOR</kwd><kwd>HIF-1&#x003b1;</kwd><kwd>Cyclin D1</kwd><kwd>cell cycle arrest</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Comisi&#x000f3;n Nacional de Investigaci&#x000f3;n Cient&#x000ed;fica y Tecnol&#x000f3;gica<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002848</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">15130011</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">3160384</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">ACT 1111</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient&#x000ed;fico y Tecnol&#x000f3;gico<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002850</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">1130250</award-id><award-id rid="cn002">1120126</award-id><award-id rid="cn002">11110076</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="40"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="9248"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> is a microaerophilic, Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the human stomach, infecting about 50% population worldwide (Peleteiro et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This infection is linked to the development of several gastric pathologies, including chronic atrophic gastritis, gastric, and duodenal ulcer, MALT lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma (Atherton, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Correa and Houghton, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection contributes to the etiology of these diseases by inducing seemingly contradictory epithelial gastric cell responses, including exacerbated apoptosis and proliferation. In conjunction, these responses lead to disturbances in the normal turnover of gastric epithelium (Jang and Kim, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), which favor atrophy, a precursor lesion in the sequence of events leading to intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and eventually cancer. Bearing this in mind, it becomes important to understand better the underlying molecular events that initiate such changes.</p><p>Consistent with the aforementioned ambiguity in host cell responses, the bacteria activate signaling pathways linked to cell cycle progression and therefore, proliferation, as well as those that result in cell cycle arrest and <italic>H. pylori</italic>-induced apoptosis (Shirin et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Ahmed et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Suzuki et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Tabassam et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). With respect to the signaling events linked to <italic>H. pylori</italic>-induced cell cycle progression, the PI3K/Akt pathway has received considerable attention. In the context of infection, activation of this pathway is associated with an increase in proliferation via induction of &#x003b2;-catenin/Tcf-Lef-dependent transcription, cell survival, and cell migration, as well as enhanced protein synthesis via mTOR activation (Nagy et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Suzuki et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Sokolova et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, despite <italic>H. pylori</italic>-induced PI3K activation, the infection promotes opposite effects in gastric cells, such as cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and apoptotic cell death (Shirin et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Ahmed et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) via mechanisms that may involve loss of Survivin (Valenzuela et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) amongst others.</p><p>On the other hand, <italic>H. pylori</italic> also promotes the induction of Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;), the inducible subunit of the heterodimeric transcriptional factor HIF-1. Generally HIF-1 increases in hypoxia where it promotes the expression of genes linked to several cell responses, including increased glycolytic metabolism, angiogenesis, survival, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, all of which are important for tumor progression (Semenza, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). As such, activation of HIF-1&#x003b1; is considered a key step that favors malignant disease progression, also in gastric cancer (Kitajima and Miyazaki, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The canonical signaling pathway controlling HIF-1&#x003b1; expression in normoxia involves the hydroxylation on proline residues (Pro402 and Pro564 in human HIF-1&#x003b1;) by proline hydroxylases and subsequent degradation via the proteasome pathway. In hypoxia, lack of oxygen leads to a decline in proline hydroxylase activity, reduced degradation and as a consequence an increase in HIF-1&#x003b1; protein (Semenza, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). However, in addition to hypoxia, HIF-1&#x003b1; can be induced by hypoxia-independent mechanisms involving activation of tyrosine kinase receptors and the downstream PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MEK/ERK pathways, as well as by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Laughner et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Fukuda et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Particularly <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection of the gastric epithelium and ROS-mediated stabilization of HIF-1&#x003b1; have been suggested to induce proliferation, inhibit cell death and ultimately favor carcinogenesis in the gastric epithelium (Koshiji et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Kitajima and Miyazaki, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Although HIF-1&#x003b1; is induced by these pathways known to favor tumor development and tumor progression, in more recent years a non-transcriptional function for this protein that contrasts with its canonical role has been described, whereby the protein prevents cell cycle progression by blocking DNA replication and modifying the expression of several proteins involved in cell cycle control, which results in inhibition of the G1/S transition (Goda et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Koshiji et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Hubbi et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Such non-transcriptional HIF-1&#x003b1; activity has been reported in hypoxia, but it remained unknown if this occurs in the context of HIF-1&#x003b1; induction by <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection of gastric cells and what the consequences might be.</p><p>Considering that <italic>H. pylori</italic> promotes both HIF-1&#x003b1; induction and PI3K/Akt pathway activation, but also can leads to cell cycle arrest, we hypothesized that HIF-1&#x003b1; may serve as a molecular switch from proliferative signaling towards cell cycle arrest in gastric cells infected with this bacterium. In this study, we evaluated if <italic>H. pylori</italic> promoted PI3K/Akt/mTOR activation, whether this increased HIF-1&#x003b1; protein levels and whether this factor contributed to cell cycle arrest mediated by <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Our results implicate PI3K and mTOR activation in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-triggered HIF-1&#x003b1; induction and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in infected gastric cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and culture conditions</title><p>The gastric cancer cell lines AGS (ATCC CRL-1793), MKN74 (JCRB0255), and KATO III (ATCC HTB-103) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Biological Industries) and antibiotics (10,000 U/ml penicillin, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin).

Our results showed that infection in the presence of MG132 and CHX partially restored Cyclin D1 levels compared to the treatment with CHX alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>), suggesting that Cyclin D1 decrease mediated by <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection is attributable in part to degradation via the proteasome. This recovery is apparently more effective in AGS sh-HIF-1&#x003b1; C7 cells; however, the degree of recovery (expressed in percent) in Cyclin D1 in the presence of MG132 is similar for both AGS sh-Scr C2 and sh-HIF-1&#x003b1; C7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>). This can be taken to suggest that the presence of HIF1&#x003b1; does not alter proteasome-mediated turnover, but rather some other post-translational process.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The infection with <italic>H. pylori</italic> has been associated with seemingly contradictory responses in human gastric samples and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. While infection with the bacteria reportedly activates proliferative and anti-apoptotic signaling, also apoptosis and cell cycle arrest have been observed (Shirin et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Ahmed et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Nagy et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Suzuki et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Tabassam et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Valenzuela et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In the present study, HIF-1&#x003b1; was identified as a molecular linker between proliferative and anti-proliferative effects, since activation of PI3K/mTOR, a well-established proliferative and survival pathway, following <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, lead to increased HIF-1&#x003b1; expression, which in turn promoted G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in gastric cells.</p><p><italic>H. pylori</italic>-mediated HIF-1&#x003b1; induction is generally attributed to oxidative stress produced by the bacteria in gastric cells (Park et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Bhattacharyya et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Kang et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Here, however, we showed that HIF-1&#x003b1; induction was due to <italic>H. pylori</italic>-induced PI3K/mTOR activation. Both mechanisms are not exclusive, but rather may be complementary, considering that oxidative stress activates many kinases, including PI3K (Schieber and Chandel, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Indeed, we have previously reported on the possible role of reactive oxygen species produced due to liberation of gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) by the bacteria in down-regulation of Survivin following infection of gastric cells (Valenzuela et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In those studies, we generated an <italic>H. pylori</italic> strain lacking GGT activity (&#x00394;<italic>ggt</italic>) and observed that such bacteria failed to induce the formation of reactive oxygen species upon infection of recipient gastric cells. Interestingly, however, &#x00394;<italic>ggt H. pylori</italic> were still able to induce HIF-1&#x003b1; upon infection of cells (data not shown). Thus, additional experiments will be necessary to determine how PI3K is activated during <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection.</p><p>Our studies showed that <italic>H. pylori</italic>-induced PI3K/Akt activation is transient, occurs relatively early on following infection and follows kinetics similar to those observed for HIF-1&#x003b1; induction. As anticipated, inhibition of PI3K completely abolished HIF-1&#x003b1; induction; however, rather unexpectedly, experiments using the Akt inhibitor (Akti) were not effective, while the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin emerged as being more relevant in this respect. Indeed, in a melanoma cell model PI3K inhibition was recently shown to prevent the activation of mTOR and cellular proliferation, but Akt inhibition did not lead to the same effect (Silva et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). These reported findings together with our own observations support the notion that mTOR activation may occur downstream of PI3K in an Akt-independent manner.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated that both cell cycle progression and cell cycle arrest are favored following <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. However, there are notable temporal differences: while infection tends to favor cell cycle progression early on, G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis are often the consequence at later stages of infection (Peek et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Shirin et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Consistent with this interpretation, our studies showed that PI3K/Akt activation occurs relatively rapidly post-infection, but then cell cycle arrest was observed later on. Interestingly, however, HIF-1&#x003b1; also was induced at early times of infection, but participates as shown here in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-mediated inhibition of the G1/S transition, indicating that infection-induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest is not a late event, but rather a phenomenon that is initiated early on post-infection. The importance of our findings resides in showing that HIF-1&#x003b1;, a protein normally associated with survival responses, particularly downstream of PI3K activation, participates in the transition to cell cycle arrest.</p><p>Beyond the HIF-1&#x003b1;-mediated arrest in G1/G0 phase following infection, the percentage of cells in G2/M phase decreased, suggesting that additional effects of <italic>H. pylori</italic> on the cell cycle occur in a manner independent of HIF-1&#x003b1;. Indeed, alterations in the G2/M phase may be related to the decrease in expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Survivin following <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, as we previously reported (Valenzuela et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, Survivin reduction is not likely linked to HIF-1&#x003b1; in our experimental conditions, because HIF-1&#x003b1; would be expected to promote transcription of BIRC5 (Survivin) and other genes (Peng et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Semenza, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). None-the-less, despite increased reporter activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), we only observed relatively modest increases in target gene expression (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) that were largely independent of HIF-1&#x003b1; induction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Likewise, loss of Survivin expression following <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection was similar after 24 h in AGS cells expressing or not HIF-1&#x003b1; (data not shown). Taken together, these observations suggest that <italic>H. pylori</italic>-induced Survivin decline may not only promote apoptotic cell death, but also decrease the number of cells in the G2/M phase in a manner independent of HIF-1&#x003b1;.</p><p>As indicated above, we previously showed that <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection induces apoptosis in infected cells after 24 h (Valenzuela et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and we corroborated here that viability decreased by roughly 40&#x02013;50% under these conditions (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">6</xref>). Thus, a concern in our studies could have been the fact that HIF-1&#x003b1; expression peaked 8 h after <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and disappeared subsequently. Specifically, the apparently non-canonical role documented here for HIF-1&#x003b1; after 24 h could have been attributed to the fact that induction of HIF-1&#x003b1; only occured in a fraction of the infected AGS cells and that those expressing HIF-1&#x003b1; selectively underwent apoptosis leaving only cells in which HIF-1&#x003b1; expression had never been induced. This can be considered a highly unlikely possibility for a number of reasons. First, the multiplicity of infection (MOI 100) employed was such that all cells should have been infected by the bacteria. Second, as far as we were able to determine, HIF1&#x003b1; was induced to a similar extent in most cells after 8 h. Indeed, using indirect immunofluorescence analysis we found that about 80% of the nuclei were HIF1&#x003b1; positive (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1C</xref>), but viability only decreased by 40&#x02013;50% after 24 h (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">6</xref>). Third, loss in viability was the same for sh-Scr C2 and sh-HIF-1&#x003b1; C7 AGS cells (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">6</xref>). Taken together, these findings make it highly unlikely that we were selectively eliminating HIF1&#x003b1; expressing cells following infection with <italic>H. pylori</italic> and therefore, that the effects observed after 24 h were not linked to induction of HIF-1&#x003b1; upon <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection.</p><p><italic>H. pylori</italic>-induced HIF-1&#x003b1; expression is associated with increased expression of Mcl-1, VEGF and Lon protease, via a transcriptional mechanism (Bhattacharyya et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Kang et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Luo et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, in our hands, we found little evidence for enhanced transcription of typical target genes due to HIF-1&#x003b1; (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), despite the notable increase in HIF-1&#x003b1; protein levels and reporter activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Thus, our results favor the notion that the G0/G1 cell cycle arrest due to HIF-1&#x003b1; induction is part of a non-transcriptional mechanism, as has been suggested in other experimental contexts (Goda et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Koshiji et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Hubbi et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Although HIF-1&#x003b1; reportedly is pro-carcinogenic, it was found here to promote cell cycle arrest, which may potentially be relevant in early steps of gastric cancer development (Xia and Talley, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that HIF-1&#x003b1; reduces the proliferation that would be necessary to offset apoptosis seen also under our experimental conditions (see Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">6</xref>). These observations may be relevant to those known to occur in the gastric epithelium following <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and the development of pre-neoplastic lesions in atrophic gastritis (Xia and Talley, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Correa and Houghton, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection induces the expression of Cyclin D1 via activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (Hirata et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we did see a trend toward increased Cyclin D1 mRNA levels that became statistically significant in those cells where HIF-1&#x003b1; had been knocked down using specific shRNA constructs after 24 h of infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). Despite this increase, Cyclin D1 protein levels decreased, likely due to enhanced protein degradation as is suggested by the notable decline in Cyclin D1 protein half-life in sh-Scr C2 AGS cells compared to that of the sh-HIF-1&#x003b1; C7 cells lacking HIF-1&#x003b1; (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Cyclin D1 activates Cdk4 and Cdk6, both of which are important in cell cycle progression through the G1 phase, and reduced Cyclin D1 expression impedes the G1/S transition (Malumbres, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Thus, the observed G1/G0 cell cycle arrest attributable here to the <italic>H. pylori</italic>-induced HIF-1&#x003b1; increase is likely to reflect the more rapid decrease in Cyclin D1 protein (reduced protein half-life) in cells expressing HIF-1&#x003b1;.</p><p>Cyclin D1 protein levels reportedly decrease following insult by genotoxic agents (Alao, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and <italic>H. pylori</italic> has been shown to induce DNA damage (Toller et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Moreover, HIF-1&#x003b1; has been suggested to favor genomic instability by inhibiting proteins necessary for DNA repair in a manner independent of its transcriptional activity (Koshiji et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Yoo et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). These mechanisms would provide an explanation for previous studies showing that HIF-1&#x003b1; induction following <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection results in DNA damage, which in turn would be expected to reduce Cyclin D1 levels, as observed in our experiments. However, in our hands we were unable to detect any significant differences in DNA damage, as assessed by the comet assay, following <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection of cells expressing or not HIF-1&#x003b1; (see Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7">7</xref>).</p><p>HIF-1&#x003b1; reportedly prevents Cyclin D1 expression by binding to the promoter region of the gene (Wen et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Consistent with this possibility, we did observe that HIF-1&#x003b1; silencing augmented Cyclin D1 mRNA after infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). However, Cyclin D1 mRNA levels did not decrease in infected cells expressing HIF-1&#x003b1;, allowing us to rule out the possibility that HIF-1&#x003b1; reduces Cyclin D1 expression by this transcriptional mechanism in our model. Instead, Cyclin D1 half-life in the presence of bacteria was reduced in sh-Scr C2 AGS cells compared to that of the sh-HIF-1&#x003b1; C7 cells lacking HIF-1&#x003b1;. Thus, HIF-1&#x003b1; promotes Cyclin D1 decrease by a post-translational mechanism. Unfortunately, although the proteasome pathway plays a prevalent role in Cyclin D1 turnover (Alao, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), and also was found to participate in our experimental system, results obtained with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 indicated that differences in Cyclin D1 protein half-life in the presence or absence of HIF-1&#x003b1; were not likely attributable to modulation of the proteasome pathway.</p><p>In conclusion, the results obtained in this study uncover a novel role for HIF-1&#x003b1; in response to <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection of gastric cells, serving to connect an initial early potentially survival response, downstream of PI3K/mTOR activation, to G1/G0 cell cycle arrest later on following infection. The sequence of events is summarized in a tentative working model (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Infection with <italic>H. pylori</italic> initially triggers PI3K activation, by as yet undefined mechanisms. Downstream activation of mTOR is depicted as stabilizing HIF-1&#x003b1; protein, which translocates to the nucleus, where instead of promoting transcription of target genes it participates in destabilizing Cyclin D1 protein and thereby favoring G1/S cell cycle arrest. Thus, HIF-1&#x003b1; emerges as an unsuspected linker between cell cycle progression/proliferation and cell cycle arrest/apoptosis, two seemingly contradictory effects observed in gastric cells following infection with <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Further studies are required to understand the <italic>H. pylori</italic>&#x02013;induced mechanisms that control this switch in HIF-1&#x003b1; function from a transcription factor that generally is thought to promote cell survival to a factor that favors cell cycle arrest.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Proposed working model</bold>. <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection promotes the activation of PI3K and subsequently, of mTOR. The activation of this pathway increases the levels of HIF-1&#x003b1;, a protein mainly present in the nucleus. <italic>H. pylori</italic>-induced HIF-1&#x003b1; decreases the Cyclin D1 levels by a post-translational mechanism. Cyclin D1 is a protein necessary for G1 phase progression. Therefore, its reduction affects the normal progression of the cell cycle, promoting an arrest in G1 phase.
