In connection with this role, we have recently described an important increase in CD4+, CD25<sup>high</sup>, Foxp3+ lymphocytes in the airway system of horses coursing with an exacerbation of severe equine asthma (EA). To explore the potential role of this population in the resolution of EA inflammation, we used a murine experimental model in which airway neutrophilic inflammation, which is similar to that observed in EA, is induced in mice by continual exposure to <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> contaminated hay.

Acute episodes of exacerbation are commonly triggered by inhalation of pollutants such as <italic>Faenia rectivirgula</italic>, <italic>Thermoactinomyces vulgaris</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Resolution of airways inflammation is likely mediated via multiple mechanisms, with Tregs potentially playing a major contributory role.</p><p>It is generally accepted that regulatory T cells play an important role in tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], control of autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and allergic-mediated processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Since the publication of the seminal paper by Shimon Sakaguchi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] pointing out the role of CD4+, CD25+ as the T lymphocytes responsible for suppression of the immune response, and because of the important contribution of Fontenot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], who described the role of transcription factor Foxp3 as a second marker for this lymphoid population, CD4+, CD25+, Foxp3+ cells have been the most studied Treg subpopulation, and their relevance has been evaluated in mice and humans in the context of different immune-mediated diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, in domestic animals, information about the role of these cells in immune regulation is scarce. In this context, we have recently demonstrated that in horses with severe EA exacerbation after challenge with moldy hay contaminated with <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, the number of Treg cells is greatly increased in lymphocytes recovered from BALF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This increase occurs in parallel with airway inflammation, but, currently, we may only speculate about the importance of Treg in the control and resolution of the acute severe EA process. An approach to answer this question may be attempted through the use of a recently described murine EA model that we have set up in our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The essence of this model is the use of hay contaminated with <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> as bedding for experimental mice. After being housed in this condition, Rockefeller (RK) mice show an increase in the percentage of neutrophils in BALF, higher levels of specific antibodies against the fungus in the respiratory tract, and histology that demonstrates intense polymorphonuclear infiltration of the airway: these are important features that also appear in EA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Moreover, in our experimental model, the disease is induced in animals over 5 months of age because younger mice are less sensitive or refractory to the induction of airway inflammation; the same age dependence occurs in the equine species, where the disease is usually observed in horses older than 8 years. In the mice of this experimental model, as also occurs in horses with exacerbation of severe EA, airway inflammation is resolved when animals return to a non-contaminated environment. It is worthy of note that the murine strain used here does not have increased individual susceptibility to airway inflammation, as does occur in EA-susceptible horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Despite this limitation of the experimental model, the description of immunological processes could be applicable to EA-susceptible and non-susceptible individuals. This murine model of severe EA presented us with the opportunity to modulate the Treg population using low doses of cyclophosphamide (Cy), as described earlier by Barbon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In this context, Askenase&#x02019;s work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] showed that Cy given at doses that do not suppress the immune response may increase delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions in mice; our laboratory also reported -in 1980- that low doses of Cy abrogate the phenomenon of antigenic competition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; at that time, this effect was attributed to the activation of a T suppressor cell. It since became evident that low doses of Cy potentiate the immune response in several animal models of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p>RK female mice, aged 2 months (young) or 8 months (old), were used in all experiments.

Moreover, there was extensive folding of the airway epithelia, which is a sign of airway smooth muscle contraction and smooth muscle hypertrophy. This inflammatory response was observed predominantly in the peribronchiolar interstitial tissues and often extended into the lamina propria and luminal surface epithelium of the affected airways. We also observed infiltration of inflammatory cells into the alveolar space.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Representative histological features of normal mice lung (<bold>a</bold>) and a normal bronchus (<bold>b</bold>) compared with micrographs of lungs obtained from mice 17 days after the initial challenge with <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> (<bold>c</bold> &#x00026; <bold>d</bold>) and of lungs from animals pretreated with cyclophosphamide and exposed to <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> (<bold>e</bold> &#x00026; <bold>f</bold>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12917_2017_1037_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig>
</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we describe that the transient decrease of CD4+, CD25+, Foxp3+ splenic T regulatory cells, induced by Cy, correlates with increased airway inflammation in mice exposed to hay contaminated with <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>.</p><p>The results presented here demonstrate that, in our experimental model, older animals (8&#x000a0;months old) showed a higher percentage of CD4+, CD25+, Foxp3+ cells in the spleen when compared to younger mice (2&#x000a0;months old). Similar findings were reported by Zhao [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], who also compared the capacity of CD4+, CD25+ cells from older and younger mice to inhibit delayed hypersensitivity, mixed lymphocyte reaction or cytokine production. From their results, they concluded that CD4+, CD25+ cells present in the older mice, were less effective in suppressing the above-mentioned assays. These facts may explain why aging produces a progressive decline in immune regulation, and in the case of horses and in the mice of our experimental model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], why age facilitates the occurrence of airway immune-mediated inflammation. On the other hand, our results indicate that upon stimulation only young mice show a significant increase of CD4+, CD25+, Foxp3+ cells percentage in the spleen, allowing us to propose that aging makes these cells less prone to proliferate or be recruited in response to antigenic challenge.</p><p>In addition, we demonstrate that Cy at low doses induces a statistically significant decrease in CD4+, CD25+, Foxp3+ cells in the spleens of mice challenged with <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, as described in normal mice by Barbon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This treatment does not affect the relative percentages of other T subpopulations, and this effect has been explained by the presence of lower ATP levels in Treg cells than in conventional T cells. This low ATP content, in turn, attenuates the synthesis of glutathione, which results in a lower capacity for Cy detoxification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Moreover, Lutsiak et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] reported that Cy decreased Treg cell numbers and led to decreased functionality by decreasing GITR and Foxp3 expression, a fact that added to the percentage diminution of Treg and could account for the exaggerated airway immune response observed in animals that received Cy. The fact that a low dose of Cy treatment prior to challenge with <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> correlated with augmented inflammation and an increase in specific immunoglobulins against the fungus in BALF, may indicate the regulatory role of Treg in this process. In this respect, IgE and IgG1 isotypes are especially important because both have the ability to bind to the high-affinity IgE Fc receptors on mast cells and basophils; therefore, their enhanced production correlates with increased sensitization of the airways and a more aggravated hypersensitivity type I reaction. On the other hand, the IgG2a isotype, which is the only IgG subclass that fixes complement in mice, appears to be responsible for type III hypersensitivity because, upon forming immunocomplexes with the antigen, complement is activated and pro-inflammatory factors such as C3a and C5a are released. Therefore, we may conclude that the increase in immunoglobulins that are responsible for type I and III hypersensitivity, could directly influence the pathogenesis of airway immune-mediated inflammation. As a consequence of antigen-antibody complex formation in the airways, complement activation and the production of other chemoattractants by resident cells in our experimental model mice and in severe equine asthma, neutrophils migrate to the airways, producing an increase of these cells in BALF, which serves as an important diagnostic finding for this disease. Our results show that there is an important increase in BALF neutrophils of mice exposed to <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, and this phenomenon is even greater in mice pretreated with low doses of Cy, which indicates that the airway immune-mediated inflammation process induced by the fungus is aggravated by Cy. This conclusion is corroborated by the histopathological study that showed that the highest degree of lung infiltration was found in animals exposed to the antigen and pretreated with Cy before challenge. Finally, considering that the natural thymus-derived, or peripherally induced adaptive Treg cell populations have been associated with the outcome of processes such as autoimmunity, transplantation rejection, cancer and mucosal tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]; it is not surprising that local airway-induced inflammation correlates with an increase of splenic Treg cells, and a regulatory role of this population as was described here. One of this study&#x02019;s limitations is the lack of information about specific Treg changes at the site of inflammation (the airways); Treg subpopulations should ideally be evaluated in the lungs and in BALF. However, these results do reveal the systemic effect of Cy on Treg populations, and strongly suggest participation of this cell subset in inflammatory processes. Another limitation of this study is that Cy has been shown to induce lung inflammation at high doses in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. While in our experience this is not noticeable through the parameters evaluated in this study (histology or BALF relative cellular content, data not shown), this does not exclude the possibility that potential damage induced by Cy may have influenced the inflammatory response against <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>.</p><p>Our study group has previously reported a similar Treg cell subpopulation in horses with exacerbated severe EA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Treg subpopulations may well play a regulatory role in inflammatory processes in different tissues, and our findings here certainly show that inhibition of Treg (through pre-treatment with Cy) coincides with severe airway inflammation after inhalatory challenge. However, translation of these results to the equine species is limited by horses&#x000b4; individual susceptibility to EA. Multiple factors may affect horses&#x000b4; susceptibility to inhalatory allergens, including heritable or genetic traits. Familial traits have been proven in said species, and the same has been shown in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The murine strain used in this study doesn&#x02019;t have an increased individual susceptibility to airway inflammation, and as such does not relate specifically to EA-susceptible horses; however, the immunological processes described here are valid across species, and could be applicable to equine susceptible and non-susceptible individuals, albeit the necessary limitations inherent to any research model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this murine model of asthma, the reduced number and function of Treg induced by low doses of Cy and which directly correlates with increased airway inflammation and lung infiltration, indicates that Treg may play a role in the regulation and resolution of severe equine asthma.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BALF</term><def><p>Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Cy</term><def><p>Cyclophosphamide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EA</term><def><p>Equine asthma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OPD</term><def><p>O-phenylenediamine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RK</term><def><p>Rockefeller</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Treg</term><def><p>T regulatory cells</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was partially supported by FONDECYT grant 1160352 Doctoral Scholarship MESECUP AUS-601, and Graduate School Faculty of Veterinary Sciences, Universidad Austral de Chile.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and material</title><p>All data generated and analyzed for this study are included in this published article.
