Several lines of evidence suggest that tanycytes may be involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Tanycytes have extended cell processes that contact the feeding-regulating neurons in the AN, particularly, agouti-related protein (AgRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons. In this study, we developed an adenovirus expressing GK shRNA to inhibit GK expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. When injected into the 3V of rats, this adenovirus preferentially transduced tanycytes. qRT-PCR and Western blot assays confirmed GK mRNA and protein levels were lower in GK knockdown animals compared to the controls. In response to an intracerebroventricular glucose injection, the mRNA levels of anorexigenic POMC and CART and orexigenic AgRP and NPY neuropeptides were altered in GK knockdown animals. Similarly, food intake, meal duration, frequency of eating events and the cumulative eating time were increased, whereas the intervals between meals were decreased in GK knockdown rats, suggesting a decrease in satiety. Thus, GK expression in the ventricular cells appears to play an important role in feeding behavior.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>As one of the main centers controlling food intake, the hypothalamus is a structure located in the basal region of the third ventricle (3V), and is composed of neurons (grouped in different nuclei) and other cells, such as tanycytes, that respond to glucose concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Tanycytes are specialized ependymal cells that cover the lower lateral walls and the floor of the 3V. Morphologically, tanycytes are polarized, lengthened cells with apical surface differentiations in direct contact with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and long basal processes that come into close contact with neurons from the periventricular nuclei of the basal hypothalamus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Based on their morphological and histochemical features, tanycytes have been classified into four subpopulations: &#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;2, &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. &#x003b1;2 and &#x003b2;1 tanycytes are localized in the lower lateral wall of the 3V. Importantly, they have extended cell processes that project into the arcuate nucleus (AN) and appear to come into close contact with feeding-regulating neurons, particularly agouti-related protein (AgRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. &#x003b2;2 tanycytes are located in the floor of the 3V. lining the median eminence (ME). These cells develop tight junctions that form the CSF-ME barrier. The proximal part of the cells is in contact with the CSF whereas the distal part of the cells forms processes in which the end feet reach the local capillary plexus in the ME. Although the specific roles of tanycytes in the hypothalamus are still under debate, their strategic proximity to and relationship with fenestrated capillaries, the blood brain barrier, axonal nerve terminals, and hypothalamic nuclei that regulate appetite/energy expenditure has placed them in a privileged position to integrate multiple inputs and regulate homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p>The pancreas, liver and small intestine are specialized organs, which respond to changes in blood glucose levels. The presence of glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) and glucokinase (GK, hexokinase IV) enables glucosensing cells to detect blood glucose levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. We and others have previously demonstrated that tanycytes express several proteins involved in the peripheral glucosensing mechanisms, such as GK (the pancreatic isoform), GLUT2 and the pore-forming subunit of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, Kir6.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p>In addition to expression, GK activity has been observed in tanycytes (S<sub>0.5</sub> of 10&#x02009;mM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Thus, it is the presence of this functional isoform of GK, together with GLUT2, that makes it possible for tanycytes to sense and respond to glucose changes with increased intracellular calcium in a mechanism that involves GK activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The fact that GK knock-out mice die a few days after birth due to acute hyperglycemia highlights the vital role of GK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Mill&#x000e1;n <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> reported hypothalamic GK to be expressed mainly in &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; tanycytes; GK expression was weak in neurons and absent in astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Similarly, Salgado <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> cloned GK expressed in tanycytes and demonstrated its functionality. However, there is enough information that validates its location in hypothalamic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Additionally, GLUT2 is expressed in hypothalamic tanycytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Interestingly, hypothalamic AN neurons do not express GLUT2; however, they are connected to nerve endings from GLUT2-expressing neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. On the other hand, GLUT2 is so well-located in the nucleus of solitary tract in neurons, and there is no evidence of glia expression in this brain region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Recent evidence obtained after molecular and pharmacological activation of GK in rats cannulated into the AN shows that GK activity specifically regulates glucose intake and dietary glucose uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Expression of glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP), a known GK inhibitor with a critical metabolic role in hepatocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, has also been demonstrated in tanycytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The presence of GKRP in tanycytes reinforces the importance of GK activity in these cells.</p><p>Over the last five decades, it has been suggested that glucose availability may regulate food intake. Despite the considerable efforts invested in unraveling the molecular mechanisms related to hypothalamic glucosensing and satiety response, there are still many unanswered questions. Here, we show that injection of an adenovirus expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting GK into the 3V generates specific transduction of ependymal glia, especially tanycytes. GK knockdown animals showed no variation in NPY and AgRP (orexigenic neuropeptides) and CART (anorexigenic). POMC (another anorexigenic neuropeptide) showed to be even decreased in response to glucose when GK was knocked down. In conclusion, knockdown animals lost the normal response to glucose (i.e. a decrease in orexigenic neuropeptides and an increase in anorexigenic neuropeptides). In addition, alterations in feeding behavior (i.e., decreased satiety) were detected. Based on these results, we postulate that hypothalamic GK activity could regulate food intake as part of a glucostatic control system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ad-shGK-EGFP injection into the basal 3V</title><p>Since the success in GK knockdown depends upon the efficiency of adenoviral transduction, time-course studies were carried out in order to determine the time point at which there was a maximal infection rate. We analyzed EGFP fluorescence levels in rat brain slices at 18, 24 and 48&#x02009;h post-i.c.v. injection of the recombinant adenovirus and compared them with levels of the tanycyte marker, vimentin, by immunostaining (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). At 12&#x02009;h post-injection, a faint signal from EGFP was detected in a few &#x003b1;-tanycytes (data not shown). At 18&#x02009;h after i.c.v. injection, EGFP expression was detected in ventricular cells with elongated processes, which due to their location, correspond to &#x003b1;-tanycytes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>, arrow), which are vimentin-positive (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B,C</xref>). High fluorescence was detected in the proximal region and basal processes of vimentin-positive cells at 24&#x02009;h after injection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D&#x02013;F</xref>). High levels of fluorescence were still observed for at least 48&#x02009;h post-i.c.v. injection in ependymal cells (1), &#x003b1;-tanycytes, (2), &#x003b2;1-tanycytes (3) and &#x003b2;2-tanycytes (4) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>). Higher magnification images are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1H and I</xref>. Importantly, EGFP fluorescence was limited to tanycytes, and no transduction of other areas was observed. EGFP was detected in the cell bodies and processes of cells lining the infundibular recess, which according to their location, correspond to &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;1-tanycytes. Particularly, the colocalization of Ad-EGFP with vimentin (shown in yellow) became more evident in &#x003b2;2-tanycytes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1G&#x02013;I</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Time-course of adenoviral transduction in the basal hypothalamus.

</p><p>EGFP fluorescence was detected in cells whose localization and morphological features are suggestive of tanycytes. We evaluated astrocyte transduction in a three dimensional reconstruction of 20 focal planes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Sections of the basal hypothalamus from transduced animals were analyzed by spectral confocal microscopy for detecting EGFP fluorescence (green) and the astrocyte markers, GFAP (blue) and vimentin (red). EGFP expression was detected in the ventricular cells having long cellular processes, which due to their location, are &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-tanycytes. The expression of GFAP and vimentin was also detectable in the same region, where a different distribution of both proteins was clearly observed. In agreement with previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, GFAP was mainly detected in the subependymal region of the ME. Analysis of the co-expression of EGFP and GFAP at higher magnification revealed no co-expression of both proteins. However, a clear co-distribution of EGFP and vimentin was observed in the proximal region (arrowhead) and processes of tanycytes (arrows). Because adenoviruses can cause gliosis, which favors the incorporation of adenovirus by reactive astrocytes, we next evaluated the colocalization of both glial markers using a focal plane and Pearson&#x02019;s correlation analysis. Colocalization of EGFP with vimentin was detected in the ventricular area (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B,E</xref>, arrows) and in several cell processes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B,E</xref>, arrowheads). The Rr value estimated for EGFP/vimentin colocalization was 0.47&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.11 in the area of &#x003b1;-tanycytes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>), whereas the Rr value for EGFP/GFAP colocalization in the same region was 0.18&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.02, suggesting that EGFP colocalized to a larger extent with vimentin as compared with GFAP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Intense EGFP and vimentin colocalization (yellow) was observed in &#x003b2;-tanycytes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>, arrows) and the long fine processes contacting AN neurons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>, arrowheads). In this region, the Rr value estimated for EGFP/vimentin colocalization was 0.53&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.06, whereas the Rr value estimated for EGFP/GFAP colocalization was 0.01&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.02 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). Astrocytes located in the proximity of &#x003b1;-tanycytes were strongly positive for GFAP, but not for EGFP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>, asterisks). The absence of transduction was detected also in astrocytes located in the proximity of &#x003b2;1-tanycytes and &#x003b2;2-tanycytes from the ME (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>, asterisks). Although other authors have reported the serotype 5 adenoviruses transduces astrocytes, our results suggest that if adenovirus is injected in the 3V, it preferentially transduced tanycytes and not astrocytes. We used the neuronal marker, NeuN, and the tanycyte marker, vimentin, to evaluate neuronal transduction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A&#x02013;E</xref>). EGFP was absent in NeuN-positive neurons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C,E</xref>), suggesting that AN neurons were not transduced with the adenovirus. Additionally, we analyzed the EGFP fluorescence in other cerebral regions, such as the cortex, hippocampus, and choroidal plexus, and compared it with that observed in the ventricular walls of the same animals. The intensity of EGFP fluorescence was systematically different in the tanycyte population with most fluorescence detected in &#x003b2;2-tanycytes then &#x003b1;-tanycytes and slightly lower in &#x003b2;1-tanycytes. Similar to &#x003b2;2-tanycytes, EGFP was detected in 3V-ependymal cells with weak signal observed in the choroid plexus and no signal detected in the cortex and hippocampus (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of EGFP in hypothalamic glial cells.

We detected no significant differences in protein levels between both animal groups, demonstrating the specificity of the GK shRNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>).

Particularly the AN, which is located in the basal region of the hypothalamus, is proximal to the ME, a circumventricular organ known to play an important role in homeostatic regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Interestingly, tanycytes link the ventricular and the vascular compartments of the ME and regulate the permeability properties of the fenestrated capillaries of the ME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Unlike the fenestrated portal vessels of the ME, which are permeable to molecules coming from the bloodstream, adjacent tanycytes present various types of tight junctions, which prevent diffusion of substances to the rest of the brain through the CSF. In this manner, blood-borne molecules enter the parenchyma of ME through the permeable vessels, and &#x003b2;2-tanycytes control their diffusion to the CSF via their tight junctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. A different subpopulation of tanycytes, &#x003b2;1-tanycytes, is in close contact with hypothalamic neurons, particularly with the glucose-responsive populations of the AN. This particular distribution of hypothalamic tanycytes represents a key point in the regulation of food intake, and we have previously demonstrated that tanycytes express GLUT2 in their proximal pole (in contact with CSF) as well as GK and ATP-sensitive potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p>GK, which catalyzes the high-K<sub>m</sub> phosphorylation of glucose, is a crucial enzyme in glucose homeostasis in different tissues involved in glucosensing. It is important to highlight that hexokinase I is also expressed in glucose-sensing cells from the VMH. However, its higher affinity for glucose (Km of 1&#x02009;mM) and kinetic properties prevent hexokinase I from modulating its activity according to changes in glucose levels. Therefore, hexokinase I from the VMH seems to be involved in the continuous generation of ATP regardless of changes in extracellular glucose concentrations whereas GK acts as a glucose sensor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Studies in GK heterozygous knockout mice have attributed a major role for GK in food intake as well as in reproductive functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In a manner similar to that reported for pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells, GK is required for active glycolysis in &#x003b2;1-tanycytes. An increase in glucose concentration generates an enhanced glycolytic flux, which leads to ATP release in cultured tanycytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. ATP activates P2Y receptors, which provokes an increase in cytosolic calcium levels at the expense of intracellular calcium sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Interestingly, ATP release and intracellular calcium increase were inhibited in experiments carried out with alloxan, a GK pharmacological inhibitor, demonstrating the importance of GK in this glucose-driven signaling mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p>Based on this mounting evidence, the aim of the present study was to knock down GK expression in tanycytes and evaluate the effects of GK suppression on feeding behavior. For this purpose, we generated a GK shRNA-containing adenovirus. Building on the success of previous studies from our laboratory demonstrating the inhibition of hypothalamic MCT1 mRNA expression using adenovirus-mediated transduction of a shRNA into the 3V and its effects on food intake, we focused on the use of this experimental tool in the present study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. We demonstrated that the adenoviral vectors selectively and effectively transduced tanycytes from the basal wall of the 3V, which is similar to Xu <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and Elizondo <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Additionally, we confirmed that GK mRNA expression was inhibited by 75% with respect to the control. Interestingly, we observed that GK knockdown increased food intake and altered feeding behavior, which is in accordance with a previous study showing that 4V injection of alloxan provokes an increase in food intake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Alloxan is a &#x003b2;-cytotoxic toxic glucose analogue and is commonly used for the development of animal model of Type-I Diabetes Mellitus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Alloxan is rapidly taken up by the pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells through GLUT2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Subsequent studies showed alloxan injected into 3V but not 4V produced a decreased food intake and an altered glucoprivic response, which was accompanied by a massive loss of tanycytes and a decrease in orexigenic NPY<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, which is related to the presence of GLUT2 in the tanycytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. We could not assess whether the adenovirus reaches more distant brain regions. Further studies are required to analyze whether adenovirus-mediated GK suppression affects the dorsal vagal complex, another cerebral region with important functions as central glucosensing functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Importantly, it has recently been described that neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract respond to acutely altered glucose concentration with either increases or decreases in neural excitability and altered synaptic input<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, which are GK-dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p>The levels of the anorexigenic peptides, POMC and CART, are known to increase in hyperglycemic conditions, whereas the levels of the orexigenic peptides, NPY and AgRP, decrease in the same conditions. Our results confirmed this pattern of neuropeptide expression in glucose-challenged control rats. However, no differences in the expression of AgRP, NPY and CART were observed between the saline-treated and glucose-treated GK knockdown animals. Interestingly, POMC expression actually decreased in glucose-treated GK knockdown animals. These results are congruent to (and may be the cause of) the augmented food intake as well as the decreased satiety observed in the GK knockdown animals in our study. However, GK inhibition in the AN has recently been shown to decrease food intake in rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. These findings may indicate that the role of GK on food intake is cell type-dependent in a manner similar to that observed for GKRP, which is present in tanycytes, and exerts opposing effects on GK compartmentalization compared to that observed in hepatocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p>Abnormal feeding initiation and termination after fasting periods due to a failure in the glucosensing mechanism has been reported for GLUT2-knockout mice subjected to fasting/feeding cycles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. GLUT2-dependent sensors regulate glucagon secretion under glucoprivic conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Thus, GLUT2 and GK expression in tanycytes may have important physiological consequences. A high Km for glucose transport and the presence of GK suggest that tanycytes may increase glucose uptake and metabolization rates proportionally to changes in blood glucose levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In this regard, GLUT2 is the only glucose transporter with a high Km that has been probed identified to have a role in glucosensing. Among the four known hexokinase isoforms, GK is the only one with a Km in the order of millimolar, which is necessary for participating in the glucosensing mechanism. It is interesting to note the possibility that different populations of tanycytes could detect glucose differently. &#x003b2;2 tanycytes contact not only de CSF but also the fenestrated capillaries (without barrier) of the median eminence, whereas &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1; tanycytes processes contact blood vessels with barrier. In this regard, it has been demonstrated that &#x003b2;2 tanycytes are able to uptake hormones such a s ghrelin and leptin from the capillaries of the ME and then transfer them to &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1; tanycytes, which release the hormones in close proximity to their target, the AN neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Based on this evidence, it is feasible to propose that &#x003b2;2 tanycytes concentrate glucose in the CSF of the infundibular recess in order to be transferred to &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1; tanycytes, being these populations the responsible of communicating glucose concentration to NA neurons. Of note, this glucosensing mechanism requires a rapid increase in CSF glucose levels, making it possible for the GK-positive glucosensing cells to generate acute responses.</p><p>For this reason, inhibition of GK expression in &#x003b2;1-tanycytes suppressed the glucosensing network, altering satiation and/or satiety signal processing by neurons from the AN. These results, together with those shown by Elizondo <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> in MCT1 knockdown animals, represent a clear evidence of the metabolic coupling existing between tanycytes and neurons. In this metabolic interaction, tanycytes would metabolize glucose to lactate, and the lactate released by tanycytes could be sensed by neurons as a measure of blood glucose concentration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). It is possible that the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle could work as a compensating mechanism for GK inhibition. However, our results indicate that it fails to completely compensate for the effect of GK inhibition.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Hypothalamic glucosensing and its inhibition by GK knockdown in tanycytes. Model of glucosensing based on the metabolic interaction between tanycytes and AN neurons. Tanycytes are a specialized ependymal cell, localized in the lower parts of the ventricular walls and the floor of the 3V. &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;1-tanycytes line the infundibular recess, and their basal projections reach orexigenic and anorexigenic AN neurons. &#x003b2;2-tanycytes cover the floor of the 3V and extend their projections inside the ME and regulate the permeability properties of the fenestrated capillaries of the ME. Hyperglycemia results in increased glucose concentrations in the 3V, which affects GK-positive &#x003b2;1-tanycytes. These glial cells sense the increased glucose by the presence of GLUT2 and GK. The GK activity could be regulated by GKRP and its nuclear compartmentalization. Lactate released by tanycytes could activate neurons of AN, generating a satiety response. GK inhibition represses the glucosensing circuit, causing an altered feeding behavior. 3V, third ventricle; ME, median eminence; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; GK, glucokinase; AN, arcuate nucleus; MCT, monocarboxylate transporter.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2017_3928_Fig7_HTML" id="d29e968"/></fig>

After the experimental treatments, the brain of each rat (six per condition) was removed, and the hypothalamic area was isolated and further dissected to obtain a region close to the 3V ependymal layer. All microdissections were performed closest to the basal 3V and under a stereomicroscope Leica M80 (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Total RNA from hypothalamus was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I (Fermentas International INC, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) to remove genomic DNA contamination. A total of 2&#x02009;&#x000b5;g of RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed into cDNA according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol of M-MULV reverse transcriptase (Fermentas International INC). Parallel reactions were performed in the absence of reverse transcriptase to control for the presence of genomic DNA. qRT-PCR reactions were prepared with a Brilliant II SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) in a final volume of 12.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;L containing 1x SYBR green Master Mix, 1&#x02009;&#x000b5;L cDNA sample and 500&#x02009;nM of the following sets of primers: cyclophilin, sense 5&#x02032;-ATA ATG GCA CTG GTG GCA AGT C-3&#x02032; and antisense 5&#x02032;ATT CCT GGA CCC AAA ACG CTC C3&#x02032; (expected product of 239&#x02009;bp); GK, sense 5&#x02032;AAA GAT GTT GCC CAC CTA CGT GCG3&#x02032; and antisense 5&#x02032;ATC ATG CCG ACC TCA CAT TGG C3&#x02032; (expected product of 510&#x02009;bp); NPY, sense 5&#x02032;-TGT TTG GGC ATT CTG GCT GAG G-3&#x02032; and antisense 5&#x02032;- CTG GGG GCA TTT TCT GTG CTT TC-3&#x02032; (expected product of 203&#x02009;bp); AgRP, sense 5&#x02032;GCA GAC CGA GCA GAA GAT GTT C3&#x02032;and antisense 5&#x02032;GTA GCA CGT CTT GAA GAA GC GG3&#x02032; (expected product of 186&#x02009;bp); POMC, sense 5&#x02032;CTC CTG CTT CAG ACC TCC ATA GAC3&#x02032; and antisense 5&#x02032;AAG GGC TGT TCA TCT CCG TTG3&#x02032; (expected product of 164&#x02009;bp) and CART, sense 5&#x02032;TCT GGG AAG AAG AGG GAC TTT CGC3&#x02032;and antisense 5&#x02032;TCC ATT TGT GTT GCT TTG GGG TG3&#x02032; (expected product of 137&#x02009;bp). All reactions were performed with an initial denaturation of 5&#x02009;min at 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, followed by 40 cycles of 30&#x02009;s at 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, annealing for 30&#x02009;s at 55&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and extension for 1&#x02009;min at 72&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in an Mx3000&#x02009;P qPCR System (Agilent Technologies). Ct values of GK mRNA obtained from three different experiments were normalized according to the 2<sup>&#x02212;&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct</sup> method, using cyclophilin as a reference gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>For protein analysis, hypothalamic samples were collected 48&#x02009;h post-adenoviral injection.

After extensive washing, the PVDF membranes were incubated for 1&#x02009;h at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000; Jackson ImmunoResearch). The reaction was developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences). Negative controls consisted of incubating the membrane in the absence of anti-GK.

Food intake was monitored during the refeeding period by providing rats with pre-weighed rat chow and weighing it again after 12&#x02009;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, schematic representation). Food intake was expressed as g consumed per 200&#x02009;g of body weight. Every interaction with the feeder was recorded by a computerized data acquisition system (VitalView, Respironics, Inc., Murraysville, PA, USA), registering frequency and time of permanency in the feeder.</p><p>A meal was considered when the bouts were larger than 10&#x02009;s into the feeder, and these meals were separated from other feeding bouts by more than 10&#x02009;min of inter-meal interval<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Except for the first meal, when a bout was longer than 30&#x02009;min, two meals were considered. The meal patterns calculated included the following: duration of the first meal (in min), frequency of meals (in number of meals in 12&#x02009;h), cumulative eating time as the total time spent in the feeder (in min), duration of inter-meal intervals (in min), and number of meal intervals. The inter-meal interval was calculated as the time period between the end of one meal and the initiation of the next one. The mean meal size was determined as the total food intake (g) divided by frequency. The mean meal duration was calculated by dividing the total meal duration (in min) by meal frequency, and the eating rate was estimated dividing total food intake (mg) by meal duration (min).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>For each data group, results were expressed as mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard error of the mean (SEM), and <italic>n</italic> refers to the number of animals that were used.
