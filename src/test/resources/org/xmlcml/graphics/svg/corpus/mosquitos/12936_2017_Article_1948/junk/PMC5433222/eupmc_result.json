    "Multiple sclerosis (MS), an epidemiologically emergent disorder in Latin America (LATAM), poses substantial socioeconomic challenges to a region where most countries remain as economies in development. MS is not health priority despite its economic and communitarian impact with a relatively low prevalence. MS treatments in LATAM have evolved from earlier long-term oral steroids and immunosuppression protocols, to platform disease modifying therapies (DMTs), to the current landscape with more advanced therapeutic molecules. Following FDA approval, a DMT may eventually become available in LATAM conditioned to industrial marketing interest. Most countries do not count all medications in their armamentarium. Access to therapy by the MS population in the region is low (9.5%-42.8%). Generic treatments, biosimilars, and follow-on complex non-biological drugs (CNBD) are commonly available in institutional formularies in LATAM despite their lack of supportive efficacy and safety data and reported molecular differences with the innovators. Savings to health systems thus far have been negligible. Medicine licensing agencies in LATAM, despite limitations in resources, have considerably improved their assessments by incorporating more modern criteria and methodology. Access to symptomatic management, rehabilitation procedures, and the role of patients associations are discussed."
