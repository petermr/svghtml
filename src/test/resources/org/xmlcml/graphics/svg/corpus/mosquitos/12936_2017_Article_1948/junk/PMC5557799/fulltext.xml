A sub group of ADHD children performed the task twice, with and without methylphenidate, a norepinephrine&#x02013;dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Off-medication patients showed a decreased pupil diameter during the task. This difference was no longer present when patients were on-medication. Pupil size correlated with the subjects&#x02019; performance and reaction time variability, two vastly studied indicators of attention. Furthermore, this effect was modulated by medication. Through pupil size, we provide evidence of an involvement of the noradrenergic system during an attentional task.

This condition is characterized by inattention, impulsiveness and hyperactivity, and is becoming increasingly recognized that many patients continue having these types of difficulties in adulthood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Most of ADHD symptoms are related to problems in behavioral and cognitive control, and have been attributed to a deficient dopaminergic signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. First-line treatment for ADHD is given by stimulants, mainly methylphenidate, and the usual second-line treatment is atomoxetine, a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Both kinds of drugs increase the catecholamine availability at synapses. This, together with evidence of a weak but consistent link between genetic polymorphisms associated to the catecholaminergic system and ADHD, prompted the widely accepted hypothesis that in this condition there is an underlying deficit in catecholaminergic neurotransmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Currently, diagnosis is being performed solely on the basis of observed behavior and reported symptoms, which carries the potential risk of over-diagnosis or under-diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Like any complex disorder, ADHD patients display clear heterogeneities at the clinical and biological levels. These differences probably explain why some patients do not respond to medication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. A biological marker that helps to objectively define the disorder, providing information about its pathophysiology and potential responses to medication, is needed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">A promising potential marker of cognitive states in humans is pupil size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. After controlling for stimulus luminance, pupil size correlates with task difficulty, emotional valence, physical effort, motor output and arousal states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Independent findings suggest that these fluctuations in pupil size reflect the state of the brain norepinephrine (NE) system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. This system originates in the locus-coeruleus (LC) and projects throughout the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and midbrain, among others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Brain areas associated with attentional processing (e.g., parietal cortex, pulvinar nucleus, superior colliculus) receive particularly dense LC-NE innervations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Data from animal models, both rodents and non-human primates, have shown a central role for the LC in selective attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Nowadays, pupil size can be monitored in a completely noninvasive way in humans, using a remote camera and infrared light. We hypothesized that if pupil size reflects the activity of the LC-NE system, which is one of the important attentional systems in humans, then pupil size is a potential and unexplored marker for attentional states in ADHD. If this is the case, changes in pupil size during an attentional task should reflect the behavioral differences observed between ADHD patients and control subjects.</p><p id="Par6">We monitored pupil size from ADHD and control subjects during a visuo-spatial working memory task (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). Deficits in these tasks are one of the most consistent impairments of executive functions in patients with ADHD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Indeed, unaffected siblings present deficits in this type of task, which are intermediate between ADHD and controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, a finding that has led some authors to propose it as an endophenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In our task, three images plus a distractor were sequentially presented and then a &#x02018;probe&#x02019; image was shown. Subjects had to evaluate if the probe image had been presented before. ADHD patients performed the task in two separate sessions, on- and off-medication, which in all cases was methylphenidate. We found that pupil size changed during the probe presentation, the attentionally most relevant cue of each trial, and covaried with the subject&#x02019;s variability in response time and performance. Furthermore, this effect was modulated by medication.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of a single trial.

Each curve in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, which corresponds to an average across subjects, shows diameter increases associated with the presentation of the dot arrays, the distractor, and the probe dot. On average, the largest increase in pupil diameter in the three groups occurred after probe onset (to see individual pupil curves, see Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). To visualize and compare the actual maxima across trials, we performed a parallel analysis. Instead of looking at the average curve per subject, we used the same pupil timeseries to average the maximum pupil size for each subject and trial, after probe onset (see Methods). These values are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>. To assess for differences between groups in maximum pupil size after probe onset, we conducted a Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance, which gave significant differences (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Associations between pupil diameter and behavioral variables</title><p id="Par10">We then evaluated associations between pupil diameter and two of the most relevant behavioral variables: performance and variability in reaction time. In all the combinations, these variables showed consistent associations, as assessed statistically by the Spearman correlation coefficient (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). We used the subjects from all three conditions to analyze these associations. The maximum pupil diameter measured after probe presentation was inversely associated to the variability in the subject&#x02019;s reaction time (Spearman correlation, rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.68, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;67). On the other hand, maximum pupil diameter was directly associated with the subjects&#x02019; performance in the task (rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.63, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;67), indicating that pupil size during the crucial part of the task was associated with the subjects&#x02019; outcome. Finally, consistent with previous reports and with the two previous associations, we found that performance was inversely associated with the variability in reaction time (rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.725, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;67). In terms of correlations within groups, we consistently found that the largest correlation values corresponded to the ADHD group, intermediate values to the mADHD group, and lowest to the Control group (see rho values in plots of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Performance did not co-vary with raw reaction time (see Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Furthermore, pupil diameter average magnitudes for the first three arrays presentations positively covariates with arrays presentation (see Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) in control (Spearman correlation, rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5864, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.29858e-07, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;66) and ADHD group (Spearman correlation, rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.27962, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;84). Nevertheless, this increase in pupil diameter does not correlates with performance and pupil diameter measured after probe presentation within subjects (see Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Relationships between task performance, reaction time variability and maximum pupil diameter after probe presentation.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Medication-associated changes in pupil diameter and behavioral variables</title><p id="Par13">Finally, we analyzed the relations between pupil size and performance, and between pupil size and reaction time, specifically in the subset of subjects which performed the task in on- and off-medication conditions. To do this, we subtracted the mean variable values of the off-medication sessions from the mean values of on-medication sessions, separately for each subject. We added the prefix &#x02018;delta&#x02019; (&#x00394;) to the new variables representing the on-medicated minus off-medicated values. We then plotted these differences against each other (See Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). For the case of &#x00394; pupil diameter and &#x00394; performance, we found a positive association, as measured by Spearman correlation (rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.75, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0007). In the case of &#x00394; pupil diameter and &#x00394; reaction time variability, we also found an association (rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.63, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0071). These results indicate that if the medication was accompanied by a large increase in performance (or a large decrease in reaction time variability) for a given subject, then it was also accompanied by a large change in pupil diameter. Interestingly, we noted that the subjects who displayed a larger change in performance were subjects which performed first the task off-medication (filled circles in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). We therefore next looked at mean values parsed by session, irrespective of medication condition (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>).

It has been recently shown in animal experiments that pupil diameter tracks arousal and attentional states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Specifically, pupil diameter covaries with neuronal activity in the LC-NE system, the so-called &#x02018;arousal&#x02019; or &#x02018;alerting&#x02019; network. The LC-driven norepinephrine modulation, which reaches almost the entire cortical surface, has a direct readout in pupil size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. This confluence of evidence from NE involvement in attentional circuits and control of pupil size prompted us to explore pupil size as a biological marker in ADHD.</p><p id="Par16">We tested ADHD and control children in a visuo-spatial working memory task (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>) previously known to be challenging for ADHD patients. A subset of ADHD children performed the task both in on-medication and off-medication conditions. Off-medication ADHD patients showed decreased pupil diameter response during the task as compared to controls (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). On average, this difference was no longer present when patients were on-medication. Specifically, we saw in our task an event-related pupil response which tracks the array presentations and displays the largest increase during the probe dot presentation. When the probe dot was presented, subjects had to pay attention to it, compare it with what they recall about the previous three arrays and make a decision. In this crucial moment of the task, the size of the induced pupil response helped us to distinguish between patients and control subjects. Given that pupil diameter reflects the activity of the LC-NE system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, these results support the involvement of the cerebral NE system in ADHD.</p><p id="Par17">We found a correlation between pupil size and subjects&#x02019; performance, measured as response accuracy and reaction time variablility, in the ADHD group. These performance metrics, are two vastly studied behavioral ADHD markers in attentional tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In this study, the correlations between these markers and pupil size were weaker in the on-medication group and display their lowest values in the control group. This association between pupil size and behavior seems to be restricted to the period after probe onset. For example, the sustained baseline increase across array presentations (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>) did not correlate with response accuracy or reaction time variability (see Supplementary Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). It has been proposed that these manifestations of ADHD (increased reaction time variability and poor accuracy in attentional tasks) could be caused by transient disruptions of attentional network activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. These disruptions are in turn caused by an increase in the activity of other internal networks, such as the default mode network. In addition, recent models have proposed the role of LC-NE circuits in so-called &#x02018;mind wandering&#x02019; periods, which might potentiate the default mode network and decrease the activity of attentional networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. This interference is characterized by a decrease in the phasic gain of the LC-NE system which, in turn, causes decreased pupil diameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Thus, there are compelling reasons for using pupil-size dynamics to characterize and diagnose ADHD.</p><p id="Par18">We also found that the subjects whose performance and reaction time variability changed more with the medication, also displayed larger pupil-size change between on-medicated and off-medicated conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Hence, the co-variation between pupil size change and behavioral change seems subject-specific. We note that the session order (on-medication or off-medication) was randomized in our subjects, which means that some of them learned the task off-medication and then were tested a second time on-medication. Besides, performance, pupil diameter and reaction time variability did not consistently change across trial blocks (see Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). This suggests that motivational or learning effects were not modulating these responses.</p><p id="Par19">Overall, the association between pupil diameter changes and ADHD behavioral performance markers, and how these associations differ between ADHD and normal children, suggest that pupil diameter changes during a visual-spatial working memory task may be a useful biological marker of ADHD. These associations are also consistent with the hypothesis that ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder related with the broadly distributed NE system, and not only a problem confined to a prefrontal-striatal dopamine circuit, as implied by the classical version of the dopaminergic hypothesis of ADHD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Subjects</title><p id="Par20">A total of 50 subjects participated in the study. 28 subjects were patients diagnosed with ADHD (4 girls, age: 10.71&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.54 years old). All ADHD children were being treated with methylphenidate. 22 subjects were non-ADHD assigned to our control group (4 girls, age: 11.58&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.50 years-old). A subgroup of 17 ADHD patients (3 girls, age: 11.19&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.86 years-old) performed the task twice, on- and off-medication (time between sessions: 180.23&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;125.17 days). The order of the sessions (on- or off-medication) was randomized to avoid carry-over effects. In the on-medication session, ADHD subjects took their regularly prescribed dose 2&#x02013;2.5 hr before the task, which is the time corresponding to the maximum drug concentration after oral administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. For off-medication sessions, children discontinued their medication 24&#x02009;h prior to the day of testing, which is enough time to remove 80% of the circulating drug levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. No significant differences were found between the groups in age, IQ, or educational level. The ADHD group had a mean IQ of 100 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11.6), while the non-ADHD group had a mean IQ of 105 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.3). All ADHD subjects were diagnosed as ADHD-Combined Subtype by a trained child neurologist according to the DSM-IV criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

The Conner&#x02019;s Abbreviated Parent&#x02013;Teacher Questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> is usually utilized to screen for symptoms of ADHD in the clinical setting. In the present study, it was used as an additional symptoms-counting tool. Participants with ADHD and those from the non-ADHD group were evaluated using this instrument as a controlling variable. Parents granted informed consent for their children&#x02019;s participation, and children signed an informed assent form.

After 500 ms, dot array presentation commenced. Three different dot arrays were presented on each trial. Each array was presented for 750 ms, with a 500 ms delay between arrays, during which a fixation cross was presented (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). After the last delay period, a distractor image was presented for 500 ms. After the distractor, a &#x02018;probe&#x02019; dot was presented for 1.5&#x02009;seconds. This was a dot within the grid, and subjects had to answer &#x02018;yes&#x02019; if the probe dot had been presented in one of the trial&#x02019;s previous arrays, or &#x02018;no&#x02019; if it had not.

During the task, the subjects kept their head in a forehead/chin rest (SR Research Ltd.). Subjects were placed at a viewing distance of 30&#x02009;cm from the display monitor. We measured illuminance data with a lux-meter positioned in the same chin-rest used by the subjects, at the same distance from the screen.

First of all, periods of blinks, in which no pupil diameter information was available, were detected by the Eyelink software. Pupil data surrounding blinks were removed from the time series used in the analyses. Pupil diameter during these periods was estimated using a cubic spline interpolation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, implemented through Matlab function <italic>spline</italic>.</p><p id="Par29">To obtain the pupil diameter average profile (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>), data of each participant were baseline-adjusted and smoothed by a bandpass Butterworth filter between 0.025&#x02009;Hz and 4&#x02009;Hz. A low-pass frequency filter extracted the high frequency noise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and a high-pass filter was applied to detrend the basal slow change of the pupil diameter across trials. Furthermore, outliers, defined as periods of pupil change (derivative function) higher than 3 standard errors from the mean were discarded. Finally, all trials with more than 50% of missing data (due to blinks or outliers) were not considered in the analysis. Unless otherwise stated, data analysis was restricted to the 8-s trial period (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). After filtering and outlier removal, the pupil timeseries was normalized by means of a z-score, separately for each trial.</p><p id="Par30">To calculate the pupil diameter maxima during probe presentation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>), we used the same z-scored pupil time series used in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>. We defined a window between 500 ms after probe onset and 500 ms after probe offset. Within that window, we calculated the maximum value of pupil diameter for each trial.

For non-paired comparisons, we implemented permutations tests using a t-statistic (difference between group means normalized by a pooled standard deviation). In this case, we first computed the t-statistic for the actual (non-permuted) data. We then implemented the permutations and calculated the t-statistic for each permutation. To assess significance, we compared the non-permuted t-value with the distribution of permuted t-values and calculated if it lied within 95% of the distribution (i.e., we used a significance level alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05).
