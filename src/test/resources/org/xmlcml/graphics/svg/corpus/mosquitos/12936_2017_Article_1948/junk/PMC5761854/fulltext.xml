This process has been extensively characterized in climacteric fruit, in contrast with non-climacteric fruit such as grape, where the process is less understood. With the aim of studying changes in gene expression during ripening of non-climacteric fruit, an Illumina based RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis was performed on four developmental stages, between veraison and harvest, on table grapes berries cv Thompson Seedless. Functional analysis showed a transcriptional increase in genes related with degradation processes of chlorophyll, lipids, macromolecules recycling and nucleosomes organization; accompanied by a decrease in genes related with chloroplasts integrity and amino acid synthesis pathways. It was possible to identify several processes described during leaf senescence, particularly close to harvest. Before this point, the results suggest a high transcriptional activity associated with the regulation of gene expression, cytoskeletal organization and cell wall metabolism, which can be related to growth of berries and firmness loss characteristic to this stage of development. This high metabolic activity could be associated with an increase in the transcription of genes related with glycolysis and respiration, unexpected for a non-climacteric fruit ripening.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Fondecyt</institution></funding-source><award-id>1150492</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1987-4130</contrib-id><name><surname>Campos-Vargas</surname><given-names>Reinaldo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Fondecyt</institution></funding-source><award-id>3150538</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balic</surname><given-names>Iv&#x000e1;n</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by projects Fondecyt 1150492 (RC) and Fondecyt 3150538 (IB).

Changes occurring during fruit ripening include epidermis discoloration, increase in soluble sugars concentration and acidity reduction, pulp softening and aroma intensification [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In climacteric fruits these changes are associated with a characteristic increasing in respiration, accompanied by an increase in ethylene production [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Given the economic relevance of many climacteric fruits, where these changes are associated with a characteristic increasing in respiration and ethylene production, several studies have been performed in order to characterize the metabolic and transcriptional changes associated to changes in the perception of fruit sensory attributes [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Grapes belong to the group of non-climacteric fruit, commonly associated with a lack of a marked increase in respiration or ethylene generation during ripening, despite that recent findings pointed to a differential ethylene response during grape development, and increased expression at veraison of ethylene biosynthesis related genes in Thompson Seedless [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Grape berry development shows a double-sigmoidal growth curve defining three growth phases, two fast-growing (phase I and phase III), separated by a slower lag-growth stage (phase-II) known as veraison [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. During this phase, the accumulation of organic acids reaches its maximum level and chlorophyll is degraded giving rise to the beginning of color change characteristic of each cultivar [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This process marks the beginning of ripening characterized among other by berry softening and cell expansion due to the active accumulation of water in the vacuole [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Recently there has been an increase in the amount of transcriptome studies which have helped to unravel some of the main molecular mechanisms involved in the ripening of grape berries [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Most of these studies have been conducted in wine grape cultivars and focused to answer questions related to biological processes of interest to the winery industry. However, quality attributes of table grape berries differ from wine grapes in several aspects, some of them in an opposite way. One example is the higher firmness in table grape berries which contribute to desirable crunchy texture, while in wine grapes is correlated with lower phenolic compounds extraction [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, the application of the knowledge derived from wine berries into table berries is not straightforward. The present study aims to increase the knowledge gap among table and wine berries ripening by means of a transcriptome analysis using the white-green table grapes cultivar Thompson Seedless.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant material and maturity parameters</title><p>Grape bunches of table grapes (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>) cultivar Thompson Seedless samples were obtained from a commercial vineyard located in Llay-Llay (Valparaiso Region, Chile) during the 2012 season.

The remaining "orphan reactions", have not yet been associated with any particular pathway. In this study, 1,372 genes were associated with metabolic pathways and obtained significant differential expression (Baggerley test, FDR &#x0003c; 0.05) in at least one of the following comparisons: A2 vs A1; A3 vs A1 and/or A4 vs A1. The expression profiles of these 1,372 genes were grouped into 10 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190087.g006">Fig 6</xref>) using <italic>K</italic>-means method [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. 77% of the genes involved in metabolic pathways were associated to clusters 1, 2, 3 and 4, and 23% were grouped to clusters 5, 6, 7 and 8.

Finally, an overrepresentation of the tRNA charging pathway was also found associated with cluster 1, obtaining the most statistically significate value (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0190087.t002">Table 2</xref>). The cluster 2 grouped the largest number of metabolic pathways significantly overrepresented compared to other clusters, which were mainly involved in synthesis of amino acids, carbohydrates and energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0190087.t002">Table 2</xref>). The route of the plastid and cytosolic glycolysis was significantly associated to cluster 2, in addition to alternative oxidase pathway, Krebs cycle and rubisco shunt.

related to carbohydrates metabolism such as degradation of sucrose (sucrose invertase) pathway and xylan synthesis. Also, pathways involved in the metabolism of fatty acids were significantly associated to cluster 3, such as biotin-carboxyl carrier protein assembly pathway and fatty acid &#x003b1;-oxidation I (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0190087.t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190087.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Four metabolic pathways were significantly associated to cluster 4, highlighting the Krebs cycle and the alternative oxidase pathway, obtaining this last route the most significant value of the entire analysis. Others pathways associated with cluster 4 were the glutamate degradation and the phosphate acquisition pathways (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0190087.t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190087.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p><p>The remaining four clusters (clusters 5, 6, 7 and 8) share the characteristics of having non-linear expression profiles presenting increase/decrease peaks at intermediate points, and less to 100 genes each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190087.g006">Fig 6</xref>). A total of nine metabolic pathways were significantly associated to these clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190087.s005">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190087.s006">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190087.s007">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190087.s008">S8</xref> Figs). Five of these routes were related to fatty acids metabolism, which three of them belong to cluster 5 showing a peak of expression at A2. Other routes represented in these clusters were pyruvate decarboxylation to acetyl CoA (cluster 6), serine racemization, glutamate removal from folate and sulfite oxidation IV (cluster 7) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0190087.t002">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec016"><title>Phenotype analysis</title><p>Fruit ripening has been extensively studied in climacteric fruit, being characterized by a respiration burst paralleled by an increase in ethylene production. In non-climacteric fruits such as grapes, the ripening would take place without such pronounced respiration and ethylene burst. However, studies in grapes related with respiratory metabolism suggest important changes in metabolism and glycolysis activity during ripening of Thompson Seedless grape berries, despite the lack of increase in respiration rate typical of climacteric fruit [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Ethylene response during grape development has also been reported, including an increased expression of ethylene biosynthesis related genes in Thompson Seedless at veraison [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These findings highlight the need to further characterize non-climacteric fruit ripening. To contribute to the knowledge of this process, we performed a transcriptome analysis during ripening of table grapes berries cv Thompson Seedless. The analysis of firmness, diameter, soluble solids accumulation and acidity showed an expected behavior according to previously reported evidence for grape berries in Phase III [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Berries showed an increase in soluble solids and in diameter from A1 to A4 and a decrease in acidity of 70%, accompanied by a firmness loss of 65% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190087.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Thus, selected berries from A1 to A4 were representative of ripening process in grape bunches of Thompson Seedless cultivar, which were used for transcriptome analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Global transcriptome analysis</title><p>Our transcriptome analysis allowed identifying about 13,000 expressed genes (FPKM &#x0003e; 2) in each analyzed point, equivalent to the half of annotated genes in the Thompson Seedless genome [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The distribution of genes by expression level category showed a similar trend in the four analyzed points, with a major peak of genes expressed at 10&#x02013;25 FPKM followed by a minor peak at over 200 FPKM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190087.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). However, it could be observed a gradual decrease in the proportion of genes of low expression range (FPKM &#x0003c; 50) accompanied by an increase in the proportion of genes in high expression range (FPKM &#x0003e; 200) from A1 to A4, generating statistically significant differences between the non-contiguous libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190087.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The GO terms enrichment analysis shows an enrichment of shared biological processes in this group of highly expressed genes at the four instances analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190087.s011">S2 Table</xref>), such as the response to abiotic stresses, particularly osmotic stress; protein synthesis, glucose metabolism and water transport. Regarding the differences, processes related to Golgi apparatus organization were presented in all points except A4. Also, enrichment of terms related with macromolecules recycling by proteasome were detected only at A4. This result, added to the fact that the total number of genes detected decreased from Al to A4 by 4%, could suggest a general cell metabolic shutdown during grapes fruit ripening.</p><p>The Venn diagram analysis showed that about 90% (11,758 genes) of the transcripts were present in all four points, while 10% (831 genes) of the genes showed an exclusive expression in one of the evaluated instances assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190087.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In agreement with statistical analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190087.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, similarity index between libraries decreases proportionally to timespan who separated them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190087.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). This result demonstrates the effectiveness in detect the transcriptome evolution during ripening, which lies in the saturation level of our analysis with four analysis points between veraison and harvest.</p><p>A great diversity of gene expression profiles was detected by clustering analysis. Approximately 65% of the genes showed a relatively linear expression profile between A1 and A4, as it was observed in the clusters 1 (continuous decrease) and 2 (continuous increase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190087.g004">Fig 4</xref>); while about a third of the genes showed a non-linear expression profile, with partial expression peaks associated to particular points (clusters 5, 6, 7 and 8). To identify the association of the different expression profiles with specific biological functions, we used the GO annotation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org">http://www.geneontology.org</ext-link>). Our results were consistent with several mechanisms described during fruit ripening, which help to validate those novel terms associated to ripening (see below). Furthermore, metabolic pathway analysis was a relevant input to support these results.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Transcriptome down-regulation during ripening</title><p>Within the group of genes that decreased their expression during ripening, the term "photosynthesis" was the most significant, grouping several genes related to chloroplast integrity. The greatest differences were related with proteins associated to light harvesting complex photosystem I and II (LHCP I and II). The decrease of photosynthetic activity and decreased expression and transcription of the photosystems associated proteins has been described in the literature as part of the ripening process in various fruits including grape [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The degradation of LHCP II is a finely coordinated process in parallel with degradation of chlorophyll-a due to the high phytotoxicity of the chlorophyll degradation intermediates [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Regarding to chlorophyll degradation pathway, our results suggests a constant expression of transcripts encoding chlorophylase, pheophorbide-a oxygenase and RCC reductase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190087.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). The pheophorbide-a oxygenase obtained the highest expression values, coinciding with it described key step role in the chlorophyll degradation pathway [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. It is noteworthy that most genes associated with photosynthesis, including chlorophyll degradation pathway, had associated transcripts even at A4. The presence of small amounts of transcripts and proteins associated with photosynthesis have been previously reported during late stage of tomato ripening [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, it remains unknown whether this finding involves <italic>de-novo</italic> synthesis or some mechanism associated to protein turn-over.</p><p>Another significant process that decreased its transcriptional activity during ripening was the isoprenoid metabolism. Isoprenoids (or terpenoids) are one of the most diverse groups of metabolites in plants, participating in several essential processes such as respiration, photosynthesis, growth and development [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Within this group, the gene coding for the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG1), a key enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the synthesis of cytosolic isoprenoids, showed a significant decrease during ripening which was also confirmed by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190087.g005">Fig 5</xref>). HMG1 mutants showed a phenotype of early senescence in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], with a possible role in the endoplasmic reticulum morphogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The down-regulation of terpenoids pathways suggest an additional input for ripening control and a putative crosstalk with senescence mechanism. Other important members of isoprenoid correspond to carotenoid compounds. One of the main functions attributed to these pigments corresponds to photo-protection through the dissipation of light energy excess absorbed by the complex antenna in the chloroplasts during photosynthesis [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In this regard, metabolic pathway analysis suggests a high expression of zeaxanthin synthesis and its violaxantin conversion in the early stages of ripening, declining after during ripening progress (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0190087.t002">Table 2</xref>). Thus, the analysis revealed the decreased expression of the 3 isoforms predicted in <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vinifera</italic> of b-carotene hydrolase which converts b-carotene to zeaxanthin (EC 1.14.13.129). Regard the conversion of zeaxanthin to violaxanthin, a great abundance of one of the four transcripts isoforms predicted for zeaxanthin epoxidase (EC 1.14.13.90) through all ripening was detected, while violaxanthin de-epoxidase, which catalyzes the reverse reaction, was not detected (EC 1.10.99.3) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190087.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Thus, our data suggest that b-carotene to violaxantin conversion is favored during ripening of Thompson Seedless grapes cultivar. This result is in concordance with findings in grape wine, where unlike that what has been seem in other fruits, the carotenoids decreased during ripening while xanthophylls increased, specially violaxanthin [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This effect could be associated with a protection mechanism of non-photochemical quenching generated by the over exposition to light of fruit in conditions of disassemblement of photosynthetic machinery across ripening.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Transcriptome up-regulation during ripening</title><p>One of the most relevant processes associated to transcriptional increase during ripening correspond to macromolecules recycling, highlighting the proteasome complex assembly process grouping 47 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190087.s012">S3 Table</xref>). Consequently, the response to misfolded proteins and protein ubiquitination were also important terms in this cluster. These processes allow a significant protein turnover control during grape ripening, where proteolysis mediated by ubiquitination could be playing an important role on its modulation [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Experiments in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> shows that the F-box protein ORE9 selectively controls the ubiquitination and proteolysis of senescence repressor elements [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Our data indicates a gradual increase in the expression of ORE9 during ripening, suggesting the influence of this mechanism during the ripening of Thompson Seedless grape berries.</p><p>The lipid metabolism was another significantly represented process that increased their expression during ripening. The degradation of lipid membranes, especially the thylakoid membranes is an important source of energy during the process of senescence in plants [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Four key enzymes are involved in this process: phospholipase D, phosphatidic acid phosphatase, lipolytic acyl hydrolase and lipoxygenase, whose concerted activity has been associated with membrane degradation in senescent tissue [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The suppression of the isoforms &#x003b1; and &#x003b4; of phospholipase D retarded the senescence promoted by ABA and ethylene in leaves of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Our analysis showed a decrease in the expression of these isoforms, however phospholipase D-&#x003b2; showed an up-regulated profile during ripening. Additionally, an increased expression of phosphatidic acid phosphatase, lipoxygenase acyl hydrolase and lipoxygenase coding genes was detected, the last also confirmed by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190087.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Consistent with this mechanism of energy recycling, the route of fatty acid b-oxidation in peroxisome has also been associated with senesce in leaves of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The GO term "fatty acid beta-oxidation" was significantly associated with increased transcriptional profile of cluster 2, and the analysis of this metabolic pathway was also consistent with this up-regulation during ripening, especially for the enoyl-CoA hydratase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190087.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). The acetyl-CoA generated from phospholipids by this pathway can directly enter the Krebs cycle or could participate in the conversion of malate through the glyoxylate cycle and subsequent transformation of sucrose through gluconeogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Regarding glyoxylate cycle, our results revealed the absence of two key enzymes transcripts as malate synthase and isocitrate lyase [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. On the other hand, the examination of the abundance of transcripts associated with control points of both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways suggest a greater activity of glycolysis during the ripening. Thus, results showed an increase in the activity of different isoforms of invertase and a constant high expression of hexokinase through grape berry ripening. In addition, an increase of phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase transcripts was detected, which are described as irreversible reactions and main control points of glycolysis [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Meanwhile, only one isoform of pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase was detected which decrease during ripening, corresponding to the main checkpoint of gluconeogenesis. These results suggest the presence of an energy recycling mechanism from phospholipids fatty acids, similar to the one described on <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> membranes of senescent leaves. However, in contrast to the mechanism described in leaves, results on grape suggest that this energy source is confined to support berry ripening rather than to be used for sucrose biosynthesis. This metabolic interpretation of transcriptional data is congruent with expected differences of a &#x0201c;sink&#x0201d; organ, such as fruit, compared to recycling metabolism of a &#x0201c;source&#x0201d; organ such as leaf during a senescence process.</p><p>Another process associated with an increased expression during ripening was the response to stress, especially osmotic stress. One of the most abundant transcript in this group corresponded to osmotin-34 belonging to the thaumatin superfamily proteins. Although the role of most of these superfamily proteins is unknown, its function is generally associated with stress response [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Experiment in tobacco suggests that the promoter region of osmotin gene act in coordination with other cis-elements involved in the response to ethylene [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Different members of WRKY and ERF transcription factors have been associated to diverse processes, including stress response and senescence [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In this respect, our results showed an increase of transcript accumulation of different members of WRKY family protein and ERF, highlighting the isoforms WRKY-23 and ERF-9, suggesting an important role of these transcription factors in the response to stress during grape berry ripening (WRKY-23 expression was confirmed by qRT-PCR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190087.g005">Fig 5</xref>). An increase in the transcription of genes associated with the organization of the nucleosome and chromatin condensation was also observed, especially at A4. These processes have been associated with late events of senescence as typical effect of PCD detected in leaf of several species [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p>One the key enzymes in ethylene metabolism is the ACC oxidase (ACCO), which catalyzes the last step of ethylene synthesis pathway [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. We detected a significant increase in the expression of ACCO during ripening (a pattern confirmed by qRT-PCR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190087.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The substrate of this enzyme is catalyzed by ACC synthase, two of which were detected in low levels along ripening. Despite grape has been characterized as a non-climacteric fruit with an independent ethylene ripening, our results suggest an increase in transcriptional activity associated with ethylene synthesis pathway. The synthesis pathway and ethylene signaling has been poorly described in grape, however differential effects associated to ripening by applications of the ethylene receptor blocker 1-MCP have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Additionally, it has been reported differential expression of various genes associated with ethylene biosynthesis in Thompson Seedless during ripening [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; and in Cabernet Sauvignon cultivar has been detected a differential expression of genes related with water transport, cell wall metabolism and transcription factors in response to ethylene application [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Accordingly, our results also showed the increase in transcript accumulation of some ethylene response transcription factors during ripening, indicating a possible influence of ethylene over the ripening control in non-climacteric fruit.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Others transcriptional profiles</title><p>Approximately 35% of the genes displayed a non-linear transcriptional behavior during ripening, with partial peaks of increases and/or decrease in their abundance of transcripts during ripening, such as observed in the expression profiles of the clusters 5 to 10. Given the diversity of expression profiles, there was a smaller amount of both GO terms and metabolic pathways associated to these clusters. Cluster 5 displayed a transcriptional peak at A2 associated to "polysaccharide metabolic process". This term group several genes involved in cell wall polysaccharides metabolism, which could be related to higher rate of firmness loss observed at this point. Other terms associated to cluster 5 were "nuclear import" and "ribosome biogenesis" grouping several ribosomal genes, many of which remained at high transcript levels up to A4. Ribosomal RNA has been proposed as an important source of nitrogen source, carbon and phosphorus derived from the catabolism of nucleic acids during senescence, registering an abundance loss of rRNA as this process progresses, while the DNA remains constant [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, the expression analysis of cluster 5 suggests a decrease in fatty acid synthesis after A2 for the synthesis of membrane phospholipids. This result is consistent with our previously suggested hypothesis related to metabolic shift of ripening cells to promote the synthesis of acetyl-CoA as a substrate for the Krebs cycle rather than the generation of membrane phospholipids. Another interesting metabolic pathway associated to cluster 5 corresponded to the 3-phosphoinositide synthesis which play an important role as second messenger [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The gene expression analysis of this route showed a preference at the transcriptional level to generate the compound phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, which has been associated with response to vesicle trafficking and polarity growth through regulation of the cytoskeleton in pollen tube [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190087.s005">S5 Fig</xref>).</p><p>Cluster 6, which presented a transcriptional peak at A3, showed an association with the terms "calcium ion transmembrane transporter activity", grouping five transmembrane calcium pumps (ACA10, ECA3, ECA4, calcium ATPase 2 and 4) predicted in plasma membrane, reticulum and vacuoles. The expression profile of one these genes was confirmed by qRT-PCR, showing an increase of transcript accumulation of ACA10 until harvest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190087.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The term "Golgi apparatus" was also associated to this cluster, grouping several genes related to cell wall polysaccharides metabolism such as pectin methyl esterase, methyltransferases, xylose isomerase, polygalacturonase inhibiting protein and xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, among others. The expression of these genes suggests a high transcriptional activity at A3 related to the cell wall metabolism, accompanied by a putative peak in the movement of calcium into the apoplast that could interact with pectins, modifying the cell wall structure. These results are consistent with biochemical evidence from grape berries cv Thompson Seedless, suggesting an important influence of calcium bridges in maintaining the cell wall pectin structure, especially close to the harvest time [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Besides, it has also been extensively described the role of calcium in the regulation of signaling pathways involved in PCD in plants [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The analysis of metabolic pathways associated with the cluster 6 showed an increase in the transcription of the genes coded for pyruvate decarboxylation to acetyl CoA activity, consistent with the increased flow of central metabolism from glycolysis to the Krebs cycle during ripening (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190087.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Moreover, the triacylglycerol synthesis pathway shows high transcriptional activity during the ripening, suggesting a highly coordinated regulation of lipid homeostasis over ripening, as discussed previously.</p><p>The cluster 7 grouped genes with a significant decrease at A4 of transcript accumulation. One of the most significant terms associated with this cluster was "protein glycosylation" which correspond to one of most widely described post-translational modifications occurring in the ER and Golgi [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The term "post-transcriptional gene silencing by RNA" was also associated with cluster 7, grouping several genes related to post-transcriptional gene regulation such as RNA helicase, splicing factors, P-loop hydrolases, Dicer-like protein, ARM and HEAT repeat containing proteins involved in the regulation of micro-RNA activity, among others. These results suggest a decrease in the post-transcriptional and post-translational metabolism of proteins at A4, suggesting a cell metabolic depression taking place after A3. Other terms highly associated with cluster 7 were "gravitropism", "cytoskeleton organization" and "cell division". These genes are associated with structural proteins of the Golgi apparatus, endomembranes systems, microtubule-associated proteins and some DNA binding proteins related with cytokinesis and polarized growth gravitropism studied in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root apex [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. The polarization effect of cell growth is a known process due to the application of growth regulators such as auxin and gibberellins in plants [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Also, a differential effect in the form of berries due to the effect of growth regulators GA3 and CPPU has been observed in table grapes [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. These results suggest a cell growth polarization effect associated to GA3 treatment, following a similar molecular mechanism to cell elongation gravitropism described in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root apex [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. In this regard, our results suggest a decrease in transcriptional activity associated to polarized cell elongation from A3 to A4, which matches the absence of changes registered in the berry diameter measurements between 72 and 78 dpa (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0190087.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Results from cluster 8 suggest a negative association between the terms "gene expression" with the term "translation" according to the ontological prediction by AgriGO. This result supports the evidence of gene expression down-regulation at A4 compared to early ripening. An enrichment of the term "RNA methylation" was also found, grouping several genes encoding for rRNA and mRNA adenosine methylase (MTA). The <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine is a modification of mRNA involved in the specific recognition of proteins that affect its translation and lifespan [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. While it is not fully understood the role of methylation of mRNA, there is evidence in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> that MTA interacts with a specific splicing factor [<xref rid="pone.0190087.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Our data suggest the constant expression of this MTA protein from A1 to A4, suggesting the involvement of this transcriptional regulation mechanism during the whole grape berry ripening process.</p><p>In order to confirm the RNASeq expression data, qRT-PCR experiments were carried out in nine representative genes of transcriptional profile diversity, considering also their biological role in the cell metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190087.g005">Fig 5</xref>).

A visible correspondence between the main physiological changes with transcriptomic profiles was detected during these grape developmental stages. Differential expression associated with cytoskeleton organization and cell wall metabolism could be associated with changes observed in berry diameter and texture. The "sink" role of grape berry also correlated with a significant decrease of photosynthesis related genes, combined with an active process of energy recycling and the increase of specific isoforms of key enzymes of the sucrose biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190087.s009">S9 Fig</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0190087.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0190087.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Most relevant biological processes involved during table grape berry ripening.</title><p>In this schematic resume, the biological processes which show an up-regulated transcriptional profile are presented in red.

Despite the non-climateric characteristic of grape fruit, our results suggest an increase on the transcriptional activity of genes associated to respiration metabolic pathways across ripening. Our results are consistent with several cell mechanisms described during fruit ripening and allow to propose molecular mechanism and specific genes related with phenotypic and physiological changes registered during table grape berry ripening.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190087.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Metabolic pathways associated to Cluster 1.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0190087.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190087.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Metabolic pathways associated to Cluster 2.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0190087.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190087.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Metabolic pathways associated to Cluster 3.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0190087.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190087.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Metabolic pathways associated to Cluster 4.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0190087.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190087.s005"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>Metabolic pathways associated to Cluster 5.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0190087.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190087.s006"><label>S6 Fig</label><caption><title>Metabolic pathways associated to Cluster 6.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0190087.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190087.s007"><label>S7 Fig</label><caption><title>Metabolic pathways associated to Cluster 7.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0190087.s007.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190087.s008"><label>S8 Fig</label><caption><title>Metabolic pathways associated to Cluster 8.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0190087.s008.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190087.s009"><label>S9 Fig</label><caption><title>Additional metabolic pathways.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0190087.s009.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190087.s010"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Quality processing results of transcriptomic libraries.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0190087.s010.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190087.s011"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Gene Ontology analysis in overexpressed genes.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0190087.s011.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190087.s012"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Gene Ontology analysis in each cluster.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0190087.s012.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0190087.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Osorio</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Scossa</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fernie</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>. <article-title>Molecular regulation of fruit ripening</article-title>. <source>Front Plant Sci.
