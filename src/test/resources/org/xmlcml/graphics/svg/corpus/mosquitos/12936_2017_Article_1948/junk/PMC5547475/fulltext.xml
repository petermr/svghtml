These proteins have potential in frozen food industry avoiding the damage in the structure of animal or vegetal foods. Moreover, there is not much information regarding the interaction of Antarctic bacterial AFPs with ice, and new determinations are needed to understand the behaviour of these proteins at the water/ice interface.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Different Antarctic places were screened for antifreeze activity and microorganisms were selected for the presence of thermal hysteresis in their crude extracts. Isolates GU1.7.1, GU3.1.1, and AFP5.1 showed higher thermal hysteresis and were characterized using a polyphasic approach. Studies using cucumber and zucchini samples showed cellular protection when samples were treated with partially purified AFPs or a commercial AFP as was determined using toluidine blue O and neutral red staining. Additionally, genome analysis of these isolates revealed the presence of genes that encode for putative AFPs. Deduced amino acids sequences from GU3.1.1 (gu3A and gu3B) and AFP5.1 (afp5A) showed high similarity to reported AFPs which crystal structures are solved, allowing then generating homology models. Modelled proteins showed a triangular prism form similar to &#x003b2;-helix AFPs with a linear distribution of threonine residues at one side of the prism that could correspond to the putative ice binding side. The statistically best models were used to build a protein-water system. Molecular dynamics simulations were then performed to compare the antifreezing behaviour of these AFPs at the ice/water interface. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that gu3B could have the most efficient antifreezing behavior, but gu3A could have a higher affinity for ice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">AFPs from Antarctic microorganisms GU1.7.1, GU3.1.1 and AFP5.1 protect cellular structures of frozen food showing a potential for frozen food industry.

By determining the interaction of AFPs at the ice/water interface, it will be possible to understand the process of adaptation of psychrophilic bacteria to Antarctic ice.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12934-017-0737-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Antifreeze proteins</kwd><kwd>Antarctica</kwd><kwd>Psychrophiles</kwd><kwd>Frozen food</kwd><kwd>Ice binding proteins</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Instituto Ant&#x000e1;rtico Chileno</institution></funding-source><award-id>Field Project RT_17-13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mu&#x000f1;oz</surname><given-names>Patricio A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par9">Antarctica is an extreme continent with the coldest temperatures, low precipitations, dryness, and almost completely covered by ice. In this continent, microorganisms dominate the genetic pool and biomass playing an important role maintaining the operation of the ecosystem. Although different microorganisms have been isolated from several places, biological records are available for only a miniscule fraction of them from land and surrounding waters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Psychrophilic microorganisms dominate the majority of Antarctic habitats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. For their survival, they have developed several growing strategies on ice including the production of compatible solutes, exopolysaccharides, and antifreeze proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Initially, antifreeze proteins (AFPs) were described in marine fishes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and defined as cryoprotectants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Currently, AFPs have been obtained from different sources including snow molds fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], sea ice diatoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], snow alga [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">AFPs are a diverse group of ice-binding proteins that prevent ice growing through the depression of the freezing point of a solution to below the melting point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This difference between freezing and melting point is referred as thermal hysteresis (TH) and results from the adsorption of the AFP on the crystal surface of ice. This interaction causes the ice growth to take place in a convex surface between adjacent AFPs, thus decreasing the freezing point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Additionally, these proteins act at low concentration and they are 200&#x02013;300 times more effective than ideal solutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], being AFPs from insects 10&#x02013;100 more than those from fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">The full biotechnological potential of AFPs has not been fully exploited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. They possess potential applications in cryopreservation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], as additive in CO<sub>2</sub> hydrate slurry production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and frozen food preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. On this last case, cucumbers and zucchinis, which have high water content, loose their crispness when they are freeze&#x02013;thaw cycles, resulting in poor product quality. Antarctica possesses a wide unexplored diversity of microorganisms to search for AFPs in order to produce these proteins in large commercial scales.</p><p id="Par14">This study was focused on searching bacterial AFPs from different places in Antarctica, including continental and insular sites. Several microorganisms were isolated and subjected to continued cycles of freezing and thawing in order to select those who produce AFPs. Crude extracts were prepared from several isolates and TH was determined using a Nanoliter Osmometer. AFP-producing isolates (AFP5.1, GU1.7.1 and GU3.1.1) were characterized using a polyphasic approach and AFPs were partially purified from these microorganisms in order to study their protective effect on cucumber and zucchini samples when they were frozen and thawed in the presence or absence of these proteins. AFP-coding genes were obtained from AFP5.1 and GU3.1.1 allowing deducing amino acids sequences in order to obtain homology models for these proteins and analyze in silico their interaction with ice crystal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sampling</title><p id="Par15">Sample collection was performed at different places in insular and continental Antarctica during Chilean Antarctic Scientific Expeditions ECA 50&#x02013;52.

Coordinates obtained were used as starting point for molecular dynamics simulations over growing ice lattices. Calculations were performed according to protocol described in methods for the three systems: gu3A-ice; gu3B-ice; afp5A-ice. After 150&#x000a0;ns dynamics simulations, it was possible to observe the ice growth in each system but no significant difference could be observed with the naked eye. Thereby, as a way to describe the structural arrangement of ice-like water molecules in the solvation shells surrounding the proteins, radial distribution functions g(r) were used. In particular, g<sub>OO</sub>(r), which corresponds to the radial distribution as a function of the distance between two oxygen atoms from water molecules, was used as a measure of the ice formation. It has been well reported that radial distribution function for crystalline ice is markedly different from that of liquid water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and has been previously used to characterize the antifreeze ability of a thermal hysteresis protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. We analyzed the behavior of water molecules located at 15&#x000a0;&#x000c5; from every atom of the proteins. Thus, what g<sub>OO</sub>(r) plot is representing is the probability of finding another oxygen atom at a given radial distance from the first, but considering only water molecules within a distance of 15&#x000a0;&#x000c5; of the protein.

The intensity of each peak indicates the abundance of ice-like water molecules in each solvation shell. Thus, at the end of each simulation, the intensity of the peaks for the three RDFs presented is higher than it was at the starting point, indicating ice-like water organization of molecules surrounding the proteins that were different at the start of dynamics. g<sub>OO</sub>(r) analysis considering the solvation shell of 15&#x000a0;&#x000c5; shed light on a possibly more efficient antifreezing behavior of gu3B.

Some studies have demonstrated that these proteins are extremely effective in the inhibition of recrystallization of ice even at very low concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. However, their working mechanism is not well understood. Moreover, their properties offer the opportunity to exploit AFPs for biotechnological applications, especially in food industry. In frozen food products, freezing provides a multitude of small ice crystals, but it is also important to prevent the formations of large ice crystals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. AFPs from Antarctic bacteria GU1.7.1, GU3.1.1 and AFP5.1 were able to reduce the damage associated to ice, probably through the reduction of the size of large ice crystals in buffer solution. This phenomenon was evidenced when zucchini and cucumbers tissues were treated with a commercial and bacterial AFPs, where small pore were (red asterisk Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) formed on plant cell walls of treated tissues in comparison to the important damage observed in absent of any AFPs. In this sense, the use of AFPs may offer the opportunity for the storage of different fruits in frozen conditions. However, the external addition of AFPs could only protect the most superficial tissues, and for this reason it is necessary to introduced AFPs-coding genes in plant organisms in order to produce fruits resistant to freezing&#x02013;thawing process. Moreover, the genetically modified plants with AFPs-coding genes may improve the texture and quality of frozen foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">AFPs have been isolated and characterized from different sources, including fish, insects, plants among others, and correspond to a structurally diverse group of proteins. These proteins are different in their structures, from amino acid sequences to tertiary structure, and they all bind to ice crystals in order to reduce the freezing point of water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], but some of them have the ability to help organisms tolerate freezing through the inhibition of ice recrystallization, or to allow adhering their host to ice. This has led to the use of the more inclusive descriptive term of Ice Binding Proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Protein modeling of afp5A, gu3A and gu3B revealed a high structural similarity to &#x003b2;-helix AFPs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) consisting of one &#x003b1;-helix and &#x003b2;-sheets arranged in a triangular prism form. The putative ice binding sites is composed of six &#x003b2;-sheets in afp5A and seven for AFPs of GU3.1.1 isolate. Similar structures have been described for AFP of <italic>Tenebrio molitor</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] and <italic>Choristoneura fumiferana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These last proteins possess a &#x003b2;-helix with a triangular cross-section and rectangular sides, containing threonine residues arranged in the ice-binding side of the prism in regular array of TXT motifs. Models for gu3A, gu3B and afp5A show threonine residues ordered in a linear disposition in one side of the prism (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) similar to AFPs from <italic>T. molitor</italic> and <italic>C. fumiferana</italic>. Moreover, the majority of these residues are arranged in TXT motif, but some of them are distributed in almost perfect TXT motifs, where threonine residues are spaced for two amino acids. These motifs have been implicated in ice binding; due to their replacement for leucine strongly decrease the antifreeze activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Ice&#x02013;AFP interaction requires that threonine residues were distinctly positioned in the ice-binding side as in the case of afp5A, gu3A and gu3B. Hydroxyl groups from threonine protrude from the center of the AFP and are exposed and accessible to interact with the ice crystal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. AFPs studied in this work (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) clearly show complementarity between ice prism planes and regularly spaced threonine residues along the ice binding surfaces of each protein.</p><p id="Par45">Molecular dynamics simulations of AFPs allowed establishing interaction of Antarctic AFPs from isolates GU3.1.1 and AFP5.1 at the water/ice interface (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Threonine residues seems to be important for this interaction and when radial distribution function of oxygen was calculated and analyzed after 150&#x000a0;ns of molecular simulation, it revealed distinctive antifreeze behaviors among them, suggesting a more efficient antifreeze activity for gu3B, due to the radial distribution peaks for ice in presence of this AFP was reduced in comparison to gu3A and afp5A (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d&#x02013;f, blue line), indicating a smaller quantity of water molecules in solid state. However, the best binding affinity was observed for gu3A (&#x02212;19&#x000a0;kcal/mol). In contrast to gu3A and gu3B, afp5A lacks two threonine residues in &#x003b2;3 and &#x003b2;16 that are present in the former and might have influence in the affinity for ice, as can be seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a where this AFP is irregularly bounded to the ice lattice. However, binding affinity of afp5 is similar to that of gu3B and shows a more regular binding.</p><p id="Par46">In conclusion, AFPs from the Antarctic microorganisms GU1.7.1, GU3.1.1 and AFP5.1 protect cellular structures of zucchini and cucumber showing their potential in frozen foods.</p><p id="Par47">Models of gu3A, gu3B and afp5A indicate that these AFPs possess a similar structure to &#x003b2;-helix AFPs, and in silico analyzes suggest that gu3B is the most efficient AFPs in order to avoid the formation of big ice crystals, even when gu3A showed a higher affinity for ice. By determining the interaction of these proteins at the ice/water interface, it will make possible to understand the process of adaptation of psychrophilic bacteria to ice in Antarctica.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec23"><p>
