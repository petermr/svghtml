The percentage of bacterial isolation (84.8%) in this study was higher when compared to other studies from Colombia (63%), Mexico (64%), and Venezuela (69%). This could probably be due to use of tympanocentesis for diagnosis of AOM. The results from the present study indicated that the majority of AOM episodes were due to <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> and NTHi, among those with bacterial growth. These results were comparable with that of an etiological study previously conducted in Chile (<italic>S pneumoniae</italic> [37%] and <italic>H influenzae</italic> [24%])<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> and other Latin American countries such as Colombia,<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> Mexico,<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> Venezuela,<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> Costa Rica,<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup> and Argentina.<sup>[<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, the present study indicated that <italic>M catarrhalis</italic> and <italic>S pyogenes</italic> were less frequently reported in AOM episodes. These observations reinforce the results from previous studies that assessed the clinical characteristics of <italic>M catarrhalis</italic> and <italic>S pyogenes</italic>.<sup>[<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</sup> In addition, AOM episodes mainly occurred in children aged between 12 and 23 months which is consistent with previous reports.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>Globally, serotypes 3, 6A, 6B, 9V, 14, 19A, 19F, and 23F have been shown to be the most prevalent serotypes of <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> causing AOM. Our present study showed that serotypes 19F, 14, and 3 constituted nearly half (46.6%) of isolated pneumococcal serotypes. These observations also corroborate the findings of earlier studies in the Latin American region, where 19F and 14 were among the top 3 pneumococcal serotypes.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup></p><p>A previously conducted study reported that <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> serotypes 14, 5, 6 (B/A), 1, and 19 (F/A) accounted for nearly two-thirds of invasive diseases in Chilean children aged &#x0003c;5 years.<sup>[<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup> In the present study, these invasive <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> serotypes were observed in over 50% of AOM episodes. The proportion of <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>H influenzae</italic> positive episodes appeared to be comparable (at least 40.0%) in unvaccinated children. In our study, no more than 6 children out of 160 (3.7%) were vaccinated with a pneumococcal vaccine. The study is based on an approximation of the children being vaccinated and pneumococcal vaccination used (PCV-10, PVC-13, or PHiD-CV) is unknown regarding each case. However, vaccine uptake was mainly for PCV-7 since the enrolled population was from the public sector where use of the vaccine was highly limited due to its cost and because it was not included in the UMV during the conduct of the study.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> This study reflects mainly the AOM etiology prior to the use of PCV in the universal mass vaccination program for Chile for the non-PCV vaccinated population.</p><p>The previous study on the etiology of AOM<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> in Chile showed a slightly higher proportion of Group A <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and slightly lower <italic>Haemophilus</italic>. It is likely that there may have been changes in the local microbiology that may have led to different results in the present study.</p><p>The percentage of <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>M catarrhalis</italic> were lower and <italic>H influenzae</italic> and <italic>S pyogenes</italic> were higher among otorrhea samples when compared to tympanocentesis (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Similar data were showed in a previously published study, except that <italic>H influenzae</italic> is found in lower percentaged among otorrhea patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</sup> There was no difference in the distribution of <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> between otorrhea and tympanocentesis patients.</p><p>It has been established that increased antibiotic usage against AOM during early childhood may lead to serious consequences like bacterial pathogens developing antibacterial resistance.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Recent studies had raised concerns with <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> developing resistance against penicillin and other antibiotics.<sup>[<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]</sup> Contrary to this, the results of the present study showed only 5.2% of <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> positive episodes to have complete resistance to penicillin, which is in line with previous studies conducted in Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Costa Rica.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup></p><p>A limitation of this study was its conduct in a public clinical setting (Hospital S&#x000f3;tero del R&#x000ed;o&#x02014;Servicio de Otorrinolaringolog&#x000ed;a, in Santiago) in Chile where the number of children enrolled might not represent the entire Chilean population. Furthermore, since incidence data were not collected in study, the scope for future ecological comparisons assessing the PCVs prior to and postintroduction into the UMV is limited with this data.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Etiological assessment of AOM revealed that <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> and nontypeable <italic>H influenzae</italic> were the leading causative bacterial pathogens of AOM in Chilean children aged &#x02265;3 months and &#x0003c;5 years. Since PHiD-CV was introduced in UMV in 2011,<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> assessment of the vaccine's impact on AOM would be of public health interest. In addition, monitoring of the AOM trends is still needed to assess potential impact of PCV vaccines etiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the physicians, study nurses, and the parents of children who participated in this study.
