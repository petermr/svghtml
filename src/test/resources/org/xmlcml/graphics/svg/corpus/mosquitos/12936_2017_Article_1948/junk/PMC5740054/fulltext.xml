<bold>Background:</bold> Though an extremely rare complication of arterial cannulation, the incidence of radial pseudoaneurysm may increase with the growing use of extended radial artery access for coronary angiography.</p><p id="Par4">
<bold>Case report:</bold> A 57&#x000a0;year-old female presented to the emergency department with painful swelling to the volar radial surface of her right wrist 5&#x000a0;days after a non-emergent transradial coronary angiography. An emergency physician used point-of-care ultrasound to diagnose a radial artery pseudoaneurysm. The high-frequency linear transducer allowed visualization of the arterial wall defect and connection between artery and hematoma on B-mode, turbulent pulsatile flow into the adjacent hematoma using color flow Doppler, and a to-and-fro waveform at the wall defect using spectral Doppler. Due to the size and characteristics of the pseudoaneurysm, as well as her pain and mild distal sensory deficits, it was determined that the patient required prompt operative repair.</p><p id="Par6">
<bold>Discussion:</bold> Bedside ultrasound is the most rapid and dynamic imaging modality for making diagnosing a radial artery pseudoaneurysm. Different techniques for treating this condition include conservative care, extended compression, thrombin injection, and surgery. Management primarily depends on the size of the pseudoaneurysm and its associated symptoms.</p><p id="Par8">
<bold>Conclusion:</bold> In addition to understanding the pathophysiology and risk factors for this condition, the emergency physician must be adept at using point-of-care ultrasound to both make the diagnosis and characterize its findings to determine management.</p><p id="Par10">

<bold>Case report:</bold> A middle-aged male with no past medical history presented to the emergency department with chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, and vomiting for 3&#x000a0;h. Distressed and diaphoretic, his vital signs were: blood pressure 92/53&#x000a0;mmHg, pulse 112, respirations 26/min, Sp02 96% on room air. His ECG was concerning for STEMI in the left circumflex territory and the catheterization team was activated in the middle of the night. Point of care TTE showed left ventricular dysfunction and a dilated aortic root with concern for an intimal tear just superior to the aortic valve, suspicious for aortic dissection. Point-of-care-ultrasound (POCUS) findings prompted the mobilization of the cardiothoracic surgery team. An aortogram showed a devastating type A aortic dissection involving the coronary arteries including a likely occlusion of the left main.</p><p id="Par15">

<bold>Objective:</bold> To assess the degree of uptake, regular use, and obstacles in applying point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), following standardized WINFOCUS Ultrasound Life Support (USLS-BL) courses in Slovenia from 2009 to 2016.</p><p id="Par22">
<bold>Methods:</bold> An online survey of all WINFOCUS USLS-BL courses in Slovenia.</p><p id="Par24">
<bold>Results:</bold> Of 660 attendees, we obtained 125 complete responses (18.9%). Majority (67%) attendees were resident or junior attending physicians. Amongst specialties represented, attendees were from family medicine (34%), emergency medicine (19%), anaesthesia (11%), and internal medicine (13%). Majority of attendees (87%) evaluated course content and depth as appropriate. Following completion of course, 73% reported having access to US machines always or most of the time; 7% of respondents use POCUS more than 5 times daily while 44% use it at least &#x0201c;few times par day to few times per week&#x0201d;, and 14% have never used POCUS after the course. Following completion of the course, attendees used POCUS for the following applications: lung (74%), DVT (73%), AAA (71%), FAST (67%), and focused cardiac (62%). 42% felt &#x0201c;confident&#x0201d; about their FAST examinations, 41% of their AAA examinations, 41% of their lung US examinations and 22% of their focused cardiac examinations. Overall, 36% did not feel confident about any of their POCUS applications; 70% responded they didn&#x02019;t keep up regular practice, mostly due to the lack of mentoring and/or continuous supervision.</p><p id="Par26">

<bold>Objective:</bold> This study sought to show that the basic level courses (WINFOCUS USLS-BL) give too much information to complete novice point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) users to process, with little chance to consolidate knowledge and skill.</p><p id="Par31">
<bold>Methods:</bold> We divided traditional 2&#x000a0;day USLS-BL course structure into two separate 1-day courses, conducted at 5&#x000a0;months apart. Prior to initiation of Day 1/introductory course, attendees were required to view 4+&#x000a0;hours of introductory videos on the basic POCUS applications. The course consisted of short review didactic lectures followed by hands-on practice of each application; measurement of abdominal aorta, the identification of a proximal DVT, the FAST exam including SC4C view of heart, the identification of lung sliding and haemothorax, and the assessment of IVC collapsibility. Following the course, all attendees (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;22) were sent an online survey (10-point Likert-like scale) in order to assess their opinions and satisfaction regarding the course materials and format.</p><p id="Par33">
<bold>Results:</bold> Post-course survey response rate was 86%. Attendees were satisfied with the pre-course videos (8.8). Prior to viewing the videos and taking the course, attendees graded their level of knowledge and skill at 3.6. After the course and after acquiring their first independent POCUS image acquisitions, attendees&#x02019; average confidence level was 6.5. The attendees&#x02019; overall course assessment was 9.2.</p><p id="Par35">
<bold>Conclusion:</bold> Attendees of a 1-day introductory POCUS course were highly satisfied with pre-course materials (flipped classroom) and overall course structure. Attendees felt reasonably confident to start acquiring images independently, especially in conjunction with an online mentoring program.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>A5 Wide-QRS tachycardia&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;shock: ruptured AAA-importance of the RUSH protocol in the ER</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>P.

<bold>Case report:</bold> 85-year-old male, with a history of chronic AF, who is admitted to the ER because of syncope while at his health center. A wide-QRS tachycardia at 250&#x000a0;bpm was detected, calling the Prehospital Emergency Unit (SUMMA) who administered Adenosine unsuccessfully, so a bolus of Amiodarone was administered. Upon arrival he presented AF with a controlled ventricular response, but hypotension around 70/40 so they began aggressive IV fluid therapy. Despite the good response in the BP with the administration of only 300&#x000a0;cc of normal saline, and given the unexplained initial hypotension, a RUSH protocol ultrasonography was performed, detecting an abdominal aorta aneurism with a diameter of 9&#x000a0;cm. An urgent CT scan was requested, confirming the existence of a 9&#x000a0;cm in diameter infrarenal aorta aneurism with an adjacent left perirenal complicated hematoma. The vascular surgeons were warned, deciding the performance of emergency surgery and inserting a right aortoiliac endoprosthesis. The patient had to undergo a second surgery because of an endoleak. Good progress, being discharged 6&#x000a0;days later.</p><p id="Par40">
<bold>Conclusions:</bold> This case demonstrates the importance of PoCUS when evaluating a patient in shock. It also comes to prove the need of providing all health resources with ultrasonography equipment, given the fact that despite all the published evidence, its use is not yet widespread.</p><p id="Par42">

<bold>Objective:</bold> To demonstrate the use of bedside ultrasound in detecting intraperitoneal free gas in acute abdomen patient presented to Emergency Department (ED)</p><p id="Par59">
<bold>Methods:</bold> A 78-year-old lady presented to ED with history of progressively worsening abdominal pain and vomiting for a week. She had multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus and hypertension. On arrival, she was lethargy but arousable to pain. Her vitals were normal except for low blood pressure (90/60&#x000a0;mmHg) and slight tachycardia (110&#x000a0;bpm). Her abdomen was distended and tender over the epigastric area. Initial erect chest radiograph was inconclusive. Bedside abdominal ultrasound then was performed using low frequency probe and revealed a free fluid in Morrison pouch and prehepatic area with presence of multiple, equally space, horizontal, hyper echoic lines repeating down the screen which resembles A-lines in thoracic ultrasound. Repeated erect chest radiograph later confirms pneumoperitoneum. Exploratory laparotomy was done and revealed perforated gastric ulcer 2.5&#x000a0;cm at anterior body of stomach.</p><p id="Par61">
<bold>Results:</bold> Perforated viscus is not common yet required urgent intervention. Although plain radiograph is always the first line imaging in patient suspected perforation, ultrasonography can usually show the signs of pneumoperitoneum if present. The main sonographic signs are increased echogenicity of peritoneal stripe and multiple reflection artifacts resemble A-lines.</p><p id="Par63">

<bold>Objective:</bold> To demonstrate the use of bedside ultrasound in detecting mediastinal mass in Emergency Department (ED).</p><p id="Par70">
<bold>Methods:</bold> We presented a case of 18-year-old male came to ED with complaints of fever, cough, shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. Examination revealed a febrile, tachypneic patient with chest examinations suggestive of left pleural effusion. Full blood count showed leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia and the chest radiograph showed massive left sided pleural effusion. However, bedside ultrasound showed presence of lung hepatization with hypoechoic lesion at anterior zone of both lungs which was atypical of lung collapse-consolidation. Urgent CT thorax was proceed and confirmed the lesion visualized on ultrasound as mediastinal lymphoma.</p><p id="Par72">
<bold>Results:</bold> A rapidly progressive symptoms should trigger the suspicion of malignancy even in the young healthy group of individuals. Between pulmonary infection and mediastinal mass, the clinical features may overlap, but the use of ultrasound helps to distinguish between these two pathologies. Sonographic signs that suggestive of mediastinal mass include lack of pleural lines and sliding sign, absence of A-profile and homogeneity difference of the lesion. This helps to decide the urgency of doing CT thorax and initiate the necessary treatment as the management greatly varies.</p><p id="Par74">
<bold>Conclusion:</bold> The use of lung ultrasound in ED is important in detecting undiagnosed mediastinal mass. It helps not only to rule out differential diagnosis, but it also helps to increase a suspicion based on initial clinical findings and laboratory parameters.</p><p id="Par76">

<bold>Background and objective:</bold> There is enough bibliography that supports the use of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and the impact it generates in the field of critical medicine. However, the main limitation in anesthesia is access to windows in patients with unchanged positions and usually in mechanical ventilation. Therefore we decided to conduct an observational study regarding the obtaining of basic echocardiographic windows in patients under general anesthesia.</p><p id="Par99">
<bold>Methods:</bold> 50 patients were enrolled. After ventilator setting, in dorsal decubitus and with the surgical fields placed, 4 windows were explored: subcostal, apical, parasternal and supraesternal. PEEP, tidal volume, BMI, age, sex were recorded. Each window was evaluated with a score: 2 points: optimal, 1 point: partial, 0 point: the window can not be obtained.</p><p id="Par101">
<bold>Results:</bold> The subcostal window could not be obtained in any patient (surgical fields). The remaining 3 windows on score of 6 possible points the average was 5.1. The parasternal window obtained a mean of 1.3 points. The most frequent cause of impossibility of access to the window was the presence of the lung. There was no difference between subgroups (PEEP&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;10 and BMI&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;30) and score obtained.</p><p id="Par103">

<bold>Background:</bold> Left Ventricular aneurysm (LVA) is one of several diagnoses to consider when evaluating chest pain in the emergency department (ED), with electrocardiogram (ECG) findings that are potentially similar to acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (aSTEMI). Point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) facilitates in establishing the diagnosis, preventing unnecessary activation of the catheterization laboratory or administration of thrombolytics.</p><p id="Par129">
<bold>Objective:</bold> We present an LVA case, illustrating classic ECG findings and sonographic changes.</p><p id="Par131">
<bold>Case report:</bold> A 79-year-old female with a remote history of myocardial infarction and percutaneous intervention presented to the ED with worsening, diffuse chest pain. Her ECG demonstrated an old infarct, but no acute ischemia. Classic ECG findings for LVA include STEMI in leads V1&#x02013;V4 with well-established Q-waves and T-wave inversions in the lateral leads. Additionally, T-wave amplitude is typically lower than the hyperacute T-waves seen in aSTEMI, and the ratio of T-wave to QRS amplitude (TW/QRS) is less than 0.36 in V1&#x02013;V4. The patient&#x02019;s physical exam was unremarkable. PoCUS echocardiogram was performed using a SonoSite X-porte ultrasound machine with a phased array probe. An impressively large LVA impeding the right ventricular function was visualized. A computed tomography thorax with contrast re-demonstrated the 8.7 by 8.5&#x000a0;cm apical LVA. The patient was admitted for further intervention but subsequently refused surgery and was discharged in stable condition.</p><p id="Par133">
<bold>Discussion:</bold> POCUS is an effective tool in diagnosing LVA to expedite clinical decision making, especially in cases where the ECG findings mimic aSTEMI.</p><p id="Par135">

<bold>Study objectives:</bold> Emergency ultrasound (EMBU) improves clinical decision-making, patient satisfaction, and time to disposition. This study investigates physicians&#x02019; knowledge, attitudes and practices about performance and documentation of EMBU to confirm intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) in Emergency Department (ED) patients at risk for ectopic pregnancy.</p><p id="Par204">
<bold>Methods:</bold> An anonymous, web-based survey was sent to attending and resident physicians in an academic, urban ED with an annual census of 65,000. Twenty EMBU questions evaluated respondents: experience (years), comfort level, knowledge about reimbursement, documentation requirements and preferred compliance prompting.</p><p id="Par206">
<bold>Results:</bold> Fifty-nine of 98 physicians (60%, 26/52 attending and 33/46 residents) reported 0&#x02013;20&#x000a0;years&#x02019; EMBU experience (median 4). Mean scores (0&#x02013;100, uncomfortable to completely comfortable) for EMBU performance and interpretation were 81 (SD 23) and 80 (SD 18) respectively. Ninety percent agree EMBU enhances patient care; 92% that it accelerates disposition and diagnoses and 88% that patients appreciate it. Twenty-three percent are unaware that EMBU is a billable procedure that can generate ED revenue. Inadequate documentation methods were reported by 54% but 49% assert they use a template designed for billing compliance. Thirty-seven percent report that Electronic Medical Record (EMR) prompts may improve documentation compliance while 64% appreciate sonographer-educator presence.</p><p id="Par208">
<bold>Conclusion:</bold> Most physicians are comfortable with EMBU for IUP and recognize the clinical benefits. Reimbursement and documentation knowledge is less prevalent. Education, promoting documentation templates and sonographer-educator support may improve documentation and reimbursement in the future.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec85"><title>A22 Middle cerebral and common carotid arteries color-Doppler evaluation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation</title><sec id="Sec86"><title>Stefano Geniere Nigra<sup>1</sup>, Carmela Graci<sup>2</sup>, Vito Sgromo<sup>3</sup>, Alberto Casazza<sup>4</sup>, Giacomo Veronese<sup>5</sup>, Miguel Montorfano<sup>6</sup>, Giovanni Ricevuti<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec87"><title><sup>1</sup>University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy; <sup>2</sup>AREU-Azienda Regionale Emergenza Urgenza, Niguarda Hospital, Milan, Italy; <sup>3</sup>AREU-Azienda Regionale Emergenza Urgenza, Policlinico San Matteo Hospital, Pavia, Italy; <sup>4</sup>ASST-Azienda Socio-Sanitaria Terrritoriale Pavia-Ospedale Civile, Vigevano, Italy; <sup>5</sup>Emergency Medicine Resident, University of Bicocca, Milan, Italy; <sup>6</sup>Department of Ultrasound, Hospital de Emergencias &#x0201c;Dr. Clemente &#x000c1;lvarez&#x0201d; (HECA), Rosario, Argentina</title><p id="Par210">

<bold>Background:</bold> Cardiac arrest (CA) is one of the major causes of death worldwide. Mortality is improving but neurological prognosis remains bad. Cerebral hypoperfusion and hypoxia are the main factors determining neurological outcome. Adequate cerebral perfusion is one of the main therapeutic goals and it is mainly based on high quality CPR. Unfortunately, there are no validated methods to monitor chest compression performance and effective cerebral blood flow during CPR.</p><p id="Par213">
<bold>Study design:</bold> Prospective cohort study.</p><p id="Par215">
<bold>Objective:</bold> MCA and CCA evaluation (peak systolic [Vs] &#x00026; end-diastolic [Vd] velocity, pulsatility index [PI]) during CPR (manual vs mechanical); relationship between MCA and CCA patterns and neurological outcome using Cerebral Performance Categories scale.</p><p id="Par217">
<bold>Methods:</bold> Inclusion criteria: all patients with non-traumatic CA undergoing CPR. After clinical diagnosis of CA, beginning of CPR and airways management, we perform MCA and CCA color Doppler evaluation. Examination is repeated, whenever possible, during all CPR steps and if any clinical condition variations (i.e. ROSC, death) occur.</p><p id="Par219">
<bold>Results:</bold> we describe a case of patient underwent sudden CA. MCA and CCA evaluation showed forward-flow during compression and back-flow pattern during chest release; during CPR, MCA profile was brain death-like pattern; during clinical pulse check evaluation (PEA, no pulse), anterograde flow pattern was registered with very poor velocities. When ROSC occurred, hyperemic MCA pattern was obtained. After 3&#x000a0;days the patient was awake with no brain damage.</p><p id="Par221">
<bold>Conclusion:</bold> Color Doppler monitoring may provide information on CPR quality and it might be useful for early detection of ROSC and prognostic stratification of patients with CA.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec89"><title>A23 Priapism: point of care Doppler ultrasound aspects</title><sec id="Sec90"><title>Marina Marazzi, Mar&#x000ed;a Fernanda Barbui, Gabriela Da Campo, Miguel Montorfano</title><sec id="Sec91"><title>Department of Ultrasound and Doppler, Hospital de Emergencias &#x0201c;Dr. Clemente &#x000c1;lvarez&#x0201d; (HECA), Avenida Pellegrini 3205, Rosario, Argentina</title><p id="Par223">

<bold>Background:</bold> Priapism is a prolonged, pathologic erection, lasting more than 4&#x000a0;h. There are 2 main types: ischemic or low-flow priapism and non-ischemic or high-flow priapism. Ischemic type is an emergency. If untreated can lead to permanent damage, corporal fibrosis and potential erectile disfunction. Color and pulse Doppler can help in the rapid differentiation of these two types of priapism.</p><p id="Par226">
<bold>Objective:</bold> To present 3 cases and review the utility of Doppler ultrasound in the triage of patients with priapism.</p><p id="Par228">
<bold>Cases series:</bold> 3 patients with priapism were evaluated in August 2017: 2 were caused by the use of non legal drugs and one occurred after an instrumentation of the urethra. All the 3 patients present low flow ischemic priapism and immediate treatment was required.</p><p id="Par230">
<bold>Discussion:</bold> Doppler ultrasound can be useful in the differentiation of high vs low flow priapism. Patients with low-flow priapism can have thrombosis of the corpora cavernosa or corpus spongiosum and decreased or absent of color flow or spectral Doppler in the cavernosal arteries with increased resistance Index if flow is present. Flow in the superficial dorsal vein and increase resistance index in the dorsal artery may be present. Low flow priapism represents 95% of the cases. Patients with high flow priapism can have normal or elevated arterial Doppler velocities. Flow suggesting arteriovenous flow fistula may be present. Usually occurs after a local trauma.</p><p id="Par232">
