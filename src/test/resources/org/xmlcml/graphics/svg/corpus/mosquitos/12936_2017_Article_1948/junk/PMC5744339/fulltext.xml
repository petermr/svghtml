Methods to produce in vitro meat generally involve the growth of muscle cells that are cultured on scaffolds using bioreactors. Suitable scaffold design and manufacture are critical to downstream culture and meat production. Most current scaffolds are based on mammalian-derived biomaterials, the use of which is counter to the desire to obviate mammal slaughter in artificial meat production. Consequently, most of the knowledge is related to the design and control of scaffold properties based on these mammalian-sourced materials. To address this, four different scaffold materials were formulated using non-mammalian sources, namely, salmon gelatin, alginate, and additives including gelling agents and plasticizers. The scaffolds were produced using a freeze-drying process, and the physical, mechanical, and biological properties of the scaffolds were evaluated. The most promising scaffolds were produced from salmon gelatin, alginate, agarose, and glycerol, which exhibited relatively large pore sizes (~200 &#x003bc;m diameter) and biocompatibility, permitting myoblast cell adhesion (~40%) and growth (~24 h duplication time). The biodegradation profiles of the scaffolds were followed, and were observed to be less than 25% after 4 weeks. The scaffolds enabled suitable myogenic response, with high cell proliferation, viability, and adequate cell distribution throughout. This system composed of non-mammalian edible scaffold material and muscle-cells is promising for the production of in vitro meat.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>biopolymer</kwd><kwd>edible material</kwd><kwd>in vitro meat</kwd><kwd>scaffold</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-materials-10-01404"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>In vitro meat is an emerging technology that involves the production of edible muscle tissue in a laboratory setting, and the use of biotechnological tools for the production of synthetic tissues. Tissue engineering of skin, cartilage, and bone have been extensively developed [<xref rid="B1-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], as has the engineering of skeletal muscle [<xref rid="B4-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While the main application of these synthetic tissues has been for biomedical uses (e.g., tissue repair and regeneration), these techniques can be applied to produce meat, avoiding the slaughter of farmed animals. There are numerous publications that discuss the potential benefits of manufacturing in vitro meat or cultured beef in the future [<xref rid="B5-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Some of these benefits are related to animal welfare, improving human health (e.g., transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), food hazards (e.g., salmonellosis), and reducing environmental impacts (e.g., global warming) [<xref rid="B8-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Methods to produce in vitro meat commonly employ the growth of myoblasts on a scaffold suspended in culture medium within a bioreactor [<xref rid="B6-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The principal goals that form the basis for this technology are: (i) the culture of muscle progenitor cells without the need to slaughter the animal; (ii) the design of edible scaffolds that are suitable for myoblast proliferation; (iii) the formulation of serum-free cell culture media; (iv) the use of bioreactors where myogenic stimuli can be applied to obtain muscle fibers. This work aims to contribute to the second goal, in developing and evaluating an edible three-dimensional (3D) porous construct (scaffold) that does not contain materials sourced from mammals.</p><p>Here, the scaffold is defined as a porous material where the anchorage-dependent cells (e.g., muscle cells) can remain viable and proliferate. The scaffold must be biocompatible, and must have appropriate microstructure and physical properties to enable cell attachment and proliferation [<xref rid="B11-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Pore size and stiffness are important scaffold design parameters for skin, bone, nerve, and muscle tissues [<xref rid="B11-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Specifically for muscle cell culture, the selection of soft porous materials with adequate microstructure and stiffness are important [<xref rid="B12-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Myoblasts have been shown to remain viable when cultured on non-edible commercial materials such as Matrigel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> [<xref rid="B13-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], however to the author&#x02019;s knowledge there are no commercially available edible scaffolds for in vitro meat production. Though there were previous reports on scaffolds for tissue engineering, there are disadvantages such as the use of non-edible crosslinkers such as carbodiimide (EDC) or glutaraldehyde [<xref rid="B1-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B11-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A further significant issue is that the available scaffolds are frequently based on mammalian biomaterials. There is extensive literature concerning the use of bovine gelatin, collagen, fibrin, hyaluronic acid, and other biopolymers that show remarkable results in the field of tissue engineering [<xref rid="B1-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B14-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A key aim of in vitro meat synthesis is to obviate mammal slaughter, and therefore mammalian-derived biomaterials should be avoided.</p><p>Non-mammalian biopolymers extracted from algae (e.g., alginate and agar) or fish species (gelatin) have been used in tissue engineering [<xref rid="B16-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, while alginate and agar permit the culture of mammalian cells [<xref rid="B18-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], they do not contain cell recognition cites&#x02014;the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequences that promote cell adhesion and migration [<xref rid="B20-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As gelatin contains RGD sequences, a promising strategy is to blend algae-derived polymers with fish-derived gelatin. Salmon gelatin is an attractive ingredient to prepare such edible and biodegradable scaffolds [<xref rid="B21-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, due to its physical properties (and lower melting temperature than other mammalian gelatin sources), salmon gelatin can be easily blended with other biopolymers, allowing the formation of copolymers and stable polyelectrolyte complexes [<xref rid="B22-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Since myoblast cell proliferation is the first step in producing muscle fibers ahead of myogenic stimulation, we hypothesize that edible materials based on salmon gelatin, modified with other biopolymers (alginate, agar, and agarose), can be used as 3D scaffolds for the cultivation of myoblasts. Here, edible scaffolds are formulated using non-mammalian biopolymers, biological active protein from salmon gelatin, combined with alginate (cross-linked by calcium alginate), and gelling agents (agar and agarose).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-materials-10-01404"><title>2.

Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec3dot1-materials-10-01404"><title>3.1. Stability of the Salmon Gelatin and Alginate Mixtures</title><p>The first step to producing these polymer scaffolds was to obtain stable hydrogel precursor solutions without precipitation of the ionic components, salmon gelatin and/or sodium alginate. Conventionally, for colloidal dispersions, Zeta potential values in ranges over |30| mV are considered stable dispersions [<xref rid="B30-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The evaluation of the zeta potential of the gelatin and alginate-containing solutions at different ratios showed that high colloidal stability was maintained at gelatin:alginate ratios of &#x0003c;7:3, and more ideally &#x0003c;6:4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-01404-f002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The stability of the colloidal solution composed of gelatin and alginate was evaluated without pH control. It is well-known that Zeta potential is a function of the pH, but our criterion was to determinate a stable blend point without pH modification, because it reflects the normal fabrication conditions of the scaffolds. However, the pH of the solutions varied only slightly, being 3.6 and 3.2 for mixtures at the extremes of 1:9 and 9:1 (gelatin:alginate), respectively.</p><p>Due to their opposing charges, the solutions are expected to form polyelectrolyte complexes when the concentrations of both polymers reach equivalence of their charges [<xref rid="B31-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Aqueous solutions containing only alginate exhibited Zeta potential values of ~&#x02212;60 mV, whereas gelatin was recorded at +20 mV. For the polymer blends evaluated, all resulted in stable dispersions where the negative charge dominated. When the gelatin:alginate ratios were between 4:6 and 6:4, the Zeta potential and pH did not change significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05; ANOVA) and were close to &#x02212;43 mV and 3.5, respectively. On this basis, the gelatin and alginate were used in equal concentrations for further studies to test the addition of plasticizers and gelling agents.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-materials-10-01404"><title>3.2. Scaffold Microstuctures</title><p>The first scaffolds prepared were made using salmon gelatin and alginate (in equal proportions) with gelling excipient (agar or agarose) and without plasticizer. SEM micrographs of the microstructures obtained when agar (formulation Ao) or agarose (formulation Bo) were used as gelling agents are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-01404-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The materials obtained exhibited unsatisfactory morphologies, with significant defects in the pore walls (micro-holes, arrowed). The average of micro-holes for materials Ao and Bo were close to 4.2 and 3.6 per pore, respectively. This damage could be the result of the freeze-drying processes, since it is known that dry salmon gelatin has crystalline domains [<xref rid="B21-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and can fracture easily.</p><p>In order to improve the structural integrity of the scaffolds, the food grade plasticizer glycerol was added to the formulations. Glycerol is an excellent edible plasticizer used in combination with biopolymers as alginate [<xref rid="B32-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Glycerol incorporation served to improve the microstructure and avoid the physical damage during the freeze-drying step. The improved scaffolds due to glycerol addition (formulations Ag and Bg) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-01404-f003">Figure 3</xref>. Glycerol effectively improved the microstructure of the material, reducing the formation of micro-holes (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; ANOVA). The average micro-holes in both scaffolds made with glycerol (Ag and Bg) was less than 0.3 per pore. In addition, the pores obtained with glycerol were better defined and had an appropriate size to cultivate cells [<xref rid="B15-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="materials-10-01404-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>It is known that material biocompatibility is related to the scaffold microstructure [<xref rid="B15-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, the addition of glycerol to the material formulation could modify the biocompatibility. Thus, the next step was to evaluate the cell biocompatibility with the scaffolds.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-materials-10-01404"><title>3.3. Biocompatibility of the Scaffolds with Myoblasts</title><p>The biocompatibility was studied by culturing myoblasts in the scaffolds. Cell adhesion and growth of viable cells was measured. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-01404-f004">Figure 4</xref> shows the viable biomass in the scaffolds over time.</p><p>Cell adhesion in the scaffolds made without plasticizer was very low&#x02014;less than 30% for formulations Ao and Bo. However, the incorporation of the plasticizer glycerol resulted in improved cell adhesion. Close to 40% cell adhesion was obtained in the scaffold with glycerol (shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="materials-10-01404-t002">Table 2</xref>). This result compared with other reports in which a cell adhesion of mesenchymal cells onto biopolymer scaffolds was reported close to 40% [<xref rid="B11-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] as an appropriate value; however, 30% is deemed low.</p><p>The growth of myoblasts was markedly more rapid within the scaffold with glycerol, and notably slow in the absence of this plasticizer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-01404-f004">Figure 4</xref>). This indicates that the microstructure of the scaffold without plasticizer was not adequate to grow muscle cells. The use of glycerol as a non-toxic plasticizer served to improve scaffold performance. For subsequent studies, only scaffolds containing plasticizers in their formulations were carried through for study. Based on these results, it was decided to perform physical and biological characterizations of both edible scaffolds (formulations Ag and Bg) using the selected plasticizer (glycerol).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-materials-10-01404"><title>3.4. Physical Behavior of the Scaffolds</title><p>The open structure of the porous scaffold with plasticizer presents a suitable microstructure for cell growth, as described above. The scaffolds containing glycerol and using different gelling agents in their formulation (agar or agarose) had different structures (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-01404-f003">Figure 3</xref>) and pore size (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="materials-10-01404-t002">Table 2</xref>). The pore size when agarose was used as gelling agent was larger than agar (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <italic>t</italic>-test), potentially affecting important physical characteristics. For instance, the microstructure may affect the stiffness, which is an important characteristic that can influence muscle cell growth [<xref rid="B5-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Another aspect that could affect the structural stability and therefore cell compatibility is water&#x02013;scaffold interaction, and therefore affinity with the cell media surrounding the cells.</p><p>Sorption isotherms of both scaffolds (Ag and Bg) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-01404-f005">Figure 5</xref>. The monolayer moisture content calculated from the GAB model is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="materials-10-01404-t002">Table 2</xref>, and indicates that scaffold formulation Bg was more hygroscopic than scaffold Ag (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <italic>t</italic>-test). In addition, the water uptake ratio in the scaffold made with agarose was higher than agar (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <italic>t</italic>-test) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="materials-10-01404-t002">Table 2</xref>). These results indicate that the scaffolds made with agarose had better water interaction capacity.</p><p>The mechanical response of the wet scaffolds, reflecting their hydrated properties in cell culture, is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-01404-f006">Figure 6</xref>. It is very important to note that the wet material is the one in contact with the cells, not the dry material, since the scaffold is immersed in culture media when it is loaded with cells. For this reason, the mechanical properties were measured with the fully hydrated material.</p><p>The storage modulus (E&#x02019;)&#x02014;which is associated with the stiffness of the material&#x02014;was determined in the hydrated condition at different frequencies and temperatures, and showed frequency dependency for both Ag and Bg scaffolds. The latter has been reported in hydrogels composed of bovine gelatin and alginate in the same frequency range, which exhibit elastic behavior [<xref rid="B33-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been reported that stiffness is a physical property that can regulate gene expression, adhesion, and proliferation of the muscle cells [<xref rid="B34-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>At physiological temperature, close to 37 &#x000b0;C, the stiffness of the scaffold Bg was larger than Ag. This result suggests that interaction between muscle cells and the material should be better when the scaffold is made with agarose.</p><p>The results obtained for the physical characterization indicate that agarose is a more appropriate gelling agent for the scaffolds, allowing the formation of a suitable structure, porosity, water interaction, and stiffness.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-materials-10-01404"><title>3.5. Biodegradation of the Scaffolds</title><p>The capacity of a material to resist degradation by biological agents is an essential attribute for designing scaffolds that provide long-term conditions and mechanical strength. The degradation produced by lysozymes at 37 &#x000b0;C is a standard assay to compare scaffolds that will be used to culture cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-01404-f007">Figure 7</xref> shows the in vitro biodegradation of the edible scaffolds (formulations Ag and Bg) incubated in simulated physiological conditions.</p><p>During the first two weeks, both scaffolds (Ag and Bg) exhibited similar degradation rates (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05; <italic>t</italic>-test). Nevertheless, after the third week, the scaffold made using agar as gelling agent (formulation Ag) showed a high level of degradation.

Biological Characterization of Myoblasts Cultured in the Scaffolds</title><p>The cell morphology of myoblasts cultured in the scaffolds for 48 h is shown in histologically stained sections of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-01404-f008">Figure 8</xref>A,B. It is well known that the morphology of myoblasts in 3D culture differs substantially from those in monolayer culture. Myoblasts did not show fibroblast-like morphology. In early stage of myogenesis, when cells are proliferating within the matrix, they remained rounded, forming later cell&#x02013;cell connections [<xref rid="B13-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. After 48 h, these cell&#x02013;cell contacts were observed as cell clusters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-01404-f008">Figure 8</xref>). Other studies have reported the formation of clusters when cells are cultivated in hydrogels [<xref rid="B14-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B35-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] or scaffolds [<xref rid="B11-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B15-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], indicating a natural stage of adaptation in the scaffold.</p><p>Cell aggregation in clusters is assumed to be an important factor in tissue culture processes. However, from the perspective of mass transfer, cell aggregation in culture generates an additional resistance effect on oxygen transportation, implying local extreme hypoxia at the center, thereby affecting cell viability and function [<xref rid="B14-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B35-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. For this reason, it is very important to estimate the cell viability and proliferation inside the scaffolds in order to evaluate if the material affects the behavior of the cells.</p><p>The presence of viable cells determined by histochemical analysis was higher in the scaffold made with agarose (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="materials-10-01404-t002">Table 2</xref>). The high viability observed for formulation Bg indicates that agarose was superior to agar in this context. It is important to emphasize that formulation Bg had more stiffness compared with scaffold Ag (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-01404-f006">Figure 6</xref>), which is a relevant parameter for the culture of muscle cells [<xref rid="B12-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B34-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This result, linked with the cell growth kinetic showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-01404-f004">Figure 4</xref>, indicates that formulation Bg allowed the cultivation of viable myoblasts. In order to confirm this, formulation Bg was studied using an immunohistochemistry assay to verify the presence of mitotic cells.</p><p>Mitotic cells were identified by the incorporation of BrdU into the newly-synthesized DNA of the cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-01404-f008">Figure 8</xref>C shows positive reaction to BrdU incorporation in cells cultivated on scaffold Bg, confirming the presence of mitotic cells. This evidence and the high cell growth (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-01404-f004">Figure 4</xref>) clearly indicate that myoblasts could proliferate in the selected scaffold (formulation Bg). In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-01404-f008">Figure 8</xref>D shows a cell inside the scaffold made with the formula Bg in a clear step of cell division (metaphase).</p><p>The distribution of the cells inside the selected scaffold (formulation Bg) was not homogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-01404-f009">Figure 9</xref>). This is an expected result, as cell growth velocity and cell clustering are dependent on nutrients diffusion and oxygen supply [<xref rid="B14-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Previous reports have informed us that cell culture into biopolymer blended scaffolds in static culture tend to grow at the bottom of the scaffolds [<xref rid="B11-materials-10-01404" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, cell viability was high in all scaffold sections. This data is important information for the design of bioreactor systems to model and predict the biomass distribution. In terms of food systems, this parameter could be used to have different layers of muscle fiber across the in vitro meat construct.</p><p>The results presented here show that scaffolds made with salmon gelatin, alginate, agarose, and glycerol permit the culture of muscle cells.
