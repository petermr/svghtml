    "Polydactyly is the most common congenital foot anomaly and consists of partial or complete duplication of a toe. Traditionally, surgical treatment has been amputation. There is little evidence when surgical treatment requires repairing the stabilizing structures of the metatarsophalangeal joint.Assess the functional and radiologic outcomes of a case of postaxial polydactyly requiring plantar plate plate and medial collateral ligament reconstruction.A 59-year-old female presented at clinic complaining from bilateral fifth toe polydactyly and metatarsalgia. A rudimentary extra toe with bony structures poorly developed was observed in the left foot. An excision was performed on the left foot. In the right foot, a fully developed extra digit was observed with medial and downwards deviation underneath the fourth metatarsal.Medial fifth-toe excision, plantar plate repair and medial collateral ligament reconstruction were performed due to malformation and widening of the distal surface of the plantar plate. Patient satisfaction and adequate functional status were observed at one-year follow-up.The plantar plate is the principal stabilizer of the MTP joint; therefore its reconstruction is of paramount importance for forefoot biomechanics."
