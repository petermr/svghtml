Recent evidence suggests that axonal guidance proteins and their receptors can also act as angiogenic regulators. Netrin, a family of laminin-like proteins, specifically Netrin-1 and 4, act via DCC/Neogenin-1 and UNC5 class of receptors to promote or inhibit angiogenesis, depending on the physiological context.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Mesenchymal stem cells secrete a broad set of classical angiogenic factors. However, little is known about the expression of non-canonical angiogenic factors such as Netrin-1. The aim was to characterize the possible secretion of Netrin ligands by Wharton&#x02019;s jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSC). We evaluated if Netrin-1 presence in the conditioned media from these cells was capable of inducing angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), respectively. In addition, we investigated if the RhoA/ROCK pathway is responsible for the integration of Netrin signaling to control vessel formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The paracrine angiogenic effect of the WJ-MSC-conditioned media is mediated at least in part by Netrin-1 given that pharmacological blockage of Netrin-1 in WJ-MSC resulted in diminished angiogenesis on HUVEC. When HUVEC were stimulated with exogenous Netrin-1 assayed at physiological concentrations (10&#x02013;200 ng/mL), endothelial vascular migration occurred in a concentration-dependent manner. In line with our determination of Netrin-1 present in WJ-MSC-conditioned media we were able to obtain endothelial tubule formation even in the pg/mL range. Through CAM assays we validated that WJ-MSC-secreted Netrin-1 promotes an increased angiogenesis in vivo. Netrin-1, secreted by WJ-MSC, might mediate its angiogenic effect through specific cell surface receptors on the endothelium, such as UNC5b and/or integrin &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1, expressed in HUVEC. However, the angiogenic response of Netrin-1 seems not to be mediated through the RhoA/ROCK pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Thus, here we show that stromal production of Netrin-1 is a critical component of the vascular regulatory machinery. This signaling event may have deep implications in the modulation of several processes related to a number of diseases where angiogenesis plays a key role in vascular homeostasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13287-017-0494-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>WJ-MSC</kwd><kwd>Angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>Netrin-1</kwd><kwd>Tissue repair</kwd><kwd>CAM assay</kwd><kwd>HUVEC</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef"/><institution>Fondecyt</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1110237</award-id><award-id>1140697</award-id><award-id>3140368</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prieto</surname><given-names>Catalina P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Palma</surname><given-names>Ver&#x000f3;nica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef"/><institution>Fondef</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>D09E1047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palma</surname><given-names>Ver&#x000f3;nica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Vascular and neuronal networks share many developmental characteristics: both are ramified systems, have similar tissue distribution patterns, and during development, cellular precursors follow similar molecular cues. Due to these similarities, researchers suggest that the formation of both networks may be regulated by common factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Additionally, vascular and neuronal pathways share several guidance factors and receptors, which play a non-canonical role to control the angiogenic process. Of particular interest is the Netrin protein family, including isoforms 1, 2, 3, and 4, which role has been well characterized in the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. More recently, these proteins and receptors have been implicated in vascular biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, since little is known about the nature of Netrin-secreting cells, the putative endothelial receptors mediating Netrin-driven angiogenesis and especially due to the existence of conflicting reports, researchers remain puzzled about the role of the Netrin proteins in vascular development and pathological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Netrin-1, the most characterized ligand of the family, is a critical axonal guidance protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] during embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and recently has been related to angiogenic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Netrins axonal functions have been linked to two classes of receptors: (1) the deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) family, including DCC and its orthologue Neogenin-1, and (2) the Unc5s family, including Unc5A through D. Notably, Netrins can also bind to integrins, a large family of transmembrane heterodimeric receptors that comprise a broad set of functions, among them, joining the actin cytoskeleton to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, Netrins acting on different receptors lead to multifunctional effects through different signaling mechanisms, depending on the developmental stage and/or tissue involved. It has been reported that Netrin-1 requires intracellular signaling mechanism involving RhoA (member of the small GTPase family), Fyn, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These mechanisms have been shown in the context of cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], branching and membrane extension on oligodendrocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], axon outgrowth in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and osteoclast differentiation in bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. While several reports demonstrate that Netrin-1 is a key angiogenic promoter, other researchers highlight its ability to negatively regulate capillary branching in the developing vascular system and to reduce endothelial cell migration in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For example in the human placenta, the most vascularized mammalian organ; Netrins have different angiogenic implications according to its localization and distribution pattern in first trimester and term placentas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Angiogenesis plays a key role during embryonic development, but also is involved in postnatal wound-healing processes. When a tissue is damaged, several events, such as cell migration and proliferation, occur to recover tissue integrity. These events involve extracellular matrix deposition, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. If the recovering tissue is not properly vascularized, the healing process can be impaired. Therefore, studying the mechanisms that modulate angiogenesis is necessary for the development of therapeutic tools in order to be able to induce proper wound healing in affected patients.</p><p>In this context, researchers have demonstrated that multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) not only improve tissue repair in response to injury and disease, but also induce angiogenesis in damaged tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this beneficial effect are not fully understood. It has been reported that MSCs do not differentiate at wound locations; they have low grafting efficiency and rather act by secreting a broad set of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and bioactive lipids into the wound microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This suggests that MSCs have a predominantly paracrine/autocrine signaling effect, and are not particularly involved in lineage differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We have recently demonstrated that MSCs isolated from the stromal tissue of the umbilical cord, named Wharton&#x02019;s Jelly mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSC) present enhanced angiogenic properties when compared to MSCs isolated from adipose tissue (AD-MSC). We showed that WJ-MSC promote angiogenic processes via a paracrine mechanism, by expressing and secreting a broad set of classic angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor AA (PDGF-AA), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-&#x003b2;2), basic fibroblast growth factor 2 (bFGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which are directly and/or indirectly linked with angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Our results suggest that WJ-MSC are a primitive stromal cell population, with therapeutic potential, due to the fact that they expanded faster and to a greater extent than adult-derived MSCs. However, the presence and secretion of other non-canonical angiogenic molecules, such as Netrins, has not yet been explored. Moreover, to our knowledge, there is no description to date of how Netrin receptors present in endothelial cells may modulate pro- and/or anti-angiogenic effects of these ligands.</p><p>Accordingly, the aim of this work was to elucidate if WJ-MSC-secreted Netrin-1 could exert an angiogenic role both in vitro in primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and in vivo in chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM assay). We here show for the first time that Netrin-1, expressed and secreted by WJ-MSC, acts as a non-canonical angiogenic factor. Moreover, we show that integrin &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1, Unc5b, and Neogenin-1 are the receptors that might participate preferentially in regulating angiogenesis. Overall, our results point to the dynamic balance between the pro- and anti-angiogenic properties of Netrin-1 highlighting the importance of the type and levels of Netrin-1 receptors present locally in the final response. Still, there is a need to further understand the mechanisms of action involved in the observed angiogenic phenomenon. Undoubtedly, these results have therapeutic potential in the development and optimization of strategies aiming to manipulate angiogenic processes for the treatment of a wide number of pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Isolation of human mesenchymal stem cells from Wharton&#x02019;s jelly of the umbilical cord (WJ-MSC)</title><p>Umbilical cords used for WJ-MSC isolation were provided by Dr. Luis Tisn&#x000e9; Brousse Hospital, Santiago, Chile.

In particular, we evaluated cell migration in response to different Netrin-1 concentrations using the wound-healing assay on HUVEC. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, the wound area at 8 h decreased only at the lowest ligand concentrations, i.e., 10 and 100 ng/mL of Netrin-1, corresponding to the reported physiological concentration range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It is noteworthy to mention that Netrin-1 effect on HUVEC migration was similar to VEGF, 59.6% vs. 60%, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Indeed the WJ-MSC secretome had pro-angiogenic potential as verified by a wound-healing assay being equal to the positive control VEGF in increasing the closure of a wound in primary HUVEC cultures (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2). As an alternative method to study the angiogenic properties of recombinant human Netrin-1, we used the two-dimensional tubule formation assay in which endothelial cells organize into tubular structures in response to an angiogenic stimulus. We found that Netrin-1 promoted tube formation in a dose-dependent manner, with low concentrations (10 ng/mL) having a greater effect than higher doses (100&#x02013;1000 ng/mL). The latter indicates that at high doses Netrin-1 could lose its ability of inducing endothelial cell migration and even prevent endothelial cell movements (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c&#x02013;d</xref>).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Discussion</title><p>Stem cell-based therapy plays an important role in the treatment of various diseases. Many authors have shown that MSCs have a significant effect on angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. We recently demonstrated that WJ-MSC seeded on bioartificial scaffolds could improve wound healing in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have explored the possible role in embryonic vasculogenesis and angiogenesis of a new group of molecules. The Netrin protein family, which acts in the nervous system in axonal guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], has later been found to be implicated in angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Moreover, recent studies suggest that Netrin-1 may become a therapeutic target in the treatment of various pathologies, either as a stimulant or inhibitor of angiogenesis such as in diabetes or cancer, respectively, even protecting the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms and receptor specificity characteristics involved in angiogenesis still require further studies.</p><p>In the present study, we show for the first time that Netrin-1 is produced and secreted by WJ-MSC throughout different passages, and has the ability to stimulate cell migration and motility in endothelial cells. We present different approaches for the detection of the non-canonical angiogenic factor, Netrin-1 in WJ-MSC. Using conditioned medium, as well as cell homogenates from WJ-MSC cultures, our data show that this type of cell is able to express and secrete Netrin-1 while Netrin-4 is almost undetectable. Interestingly, <italic>Netrin-4</italic> mRNA is revealed in other MSC populations, presenting the highest expression in BM-MSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Notably, our Western blot analysis revealed that all assayed MSC sources express Netrin-1 protein. So far, no evidence exists indicating Netrin-1 expression in AD-MSC or BM-MSC. However, Netrin-1, acting through its receptor UNC5b, has been involved in osteoclast differentiation in the bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. On the other hand, in obese adipose tissue, the ligand recently has been implicated in reduced migratory capacity of macrophages, increasing its accumulation in adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Moreover, Netrin-1 was informed to be highly expressed in obese but not lean adipose tissue of humans and mice, acting as a neuroimmune guidance cue via its receptor UNC5b. The latter could explain our observation showing a lower expression of Netrin-1 in AD-MSC in comparison to BM-MSC. Nevertheless, at this point we cannot infer that Netrin-1 is differentially expressed among AD-MSC versus BM-MSC. Recently, in rodents, transplantation of either BM-MSC or AD-MSC with Netrin-1, has shown to improve the function of the sciatic nerve after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and also to exert a protective role after myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Given the reported beneficial impact of Netrin-1 in tissue repair, the study of Netrin-1 and its cognate receptors in these MSC populations warrant further investigation.</p><p>Different researchers have studied the role of Netrin-1 in angiogenesis. Some of them demonstrating that it has a positive, while others, showing a negative angiogenic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Revealing its function is complex due to the fact that the ligands are highly dependent on the cellular context, the receptor through which they exert their function, and their relative concentrations. We therefore evaluated the effect of Netrin-1 on angiogenesis on HUVEC primary cultures only after confirming its expression and secretion by WJ-MSC. We found that Netrin-1 promoted migration and angiogenesis in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, peaking around 50 ng/mL. Moreover, Netrin-1 maintained its positive angiogenic effect even when its dose was a thousand times lower (pg/mL) than reported in many experimental setups. These results agree with recent research that highlights the pro-angiogenic role of Netrin-1 at low doses (10&#x02013;100 ng/mL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Our data are also in line with research reporting an inhibitory effect of this ligand at high doses (1 &#x003bc;g/mL) in angiogenesis, thus confirming the potential dual role of Netrin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Some of the reported inhibitory effects, although, were observed in cells that are supplied either from single donors or from pooled donor lines (commercially available HUVEC cell lines) incubated in the presence of complete medium, without considering that Netrin-1 is already present within the serum (data not shown, VP personal communication). It is therefore worth mentioning that our study used exclusively HUVEC primary cultures from single donors in serum-starved conditions.</p><p>Our results show that WJ-MSC produce and secrete low amounts of Netrin-1 (25&#x02013;30 pg/mL), similar to those recently established in the umbilical cord blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We found that the optimum pro-angiogenic effect was between 10&#x02013;100 ng/mL of recombinant Netrin-1, which is within the admitted physiological range reported to be between 50&#x02013;150 ng/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Our result is therefore consistent with the hypothesis that Netrin-1 stimulates endothelial cell migration in vitro at low concentrations while conversely, at higher concentrations tends to promote endothelial cell migration to a lesser extent. This dose-dependency is termed a biphasic &#x0201c;bell-shaped&#x0201d; dose-response curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Clearly, to reveal this bifunctional mode of action of Netrin-1 a more comprehensive in vivo investigation is required.</p><p>We were also interested in evaluating Netrin-1&#x02019;s specific contribution to angiogenesis by inhibiting its function. Seeding HUVEC on Matrigel in presence of a drug targeting Netrin-1, 2F5, or antibody-mediated blockade of Netrin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] suggests that Netrin-1 signaling pathway directs approximately 70% of the angiogenic process. These results are in accordance with other reports that show the same effect using other experimental approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. We can therefore irrefutably conclude that this ligand is involved in endothelial angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Netrin-1 and its numerous receptors regulate different cellular responses by activating a variety of intracellular pathways. In a first attempt to elucidate the underlying signaling mechanisms we focused on Netrin receptor expression in HUVEC. Examining the Netrin&#x02019;s classical and non-classical receptor repertoire, we found that HUVEC expressed low amounts of Neogenin-1. HUVEC did not express the Neogenin-1 homologue, DCC. The absence of DCC expression in HUVEC has been well documented in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. However, much controversy exists regarding the expression of Neogenin-1 in HUVEC. Many studies investigated Neogenin-1 only measuring mRNA levels and protein expression compared to other tissues, mainly to brain tissue that reveals much higher Neogenin-1 levels. Based on these comparisons, researchers conclude that Neogenin-1 is almost undetectable or not present in HUVEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Nevertherless, our ongoing research suggests that the expression of Neogenin-1 could be of functional relevance (VP, personal communication). Our present findings demonstrate for the first time in primary cell culture of HUVEC that members of the UNC5 family, described as dependence receptors for Netrin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] are expressed. UNC5 receptors facilitate repulsion and therefore mediate the anti-angiogenic effect in endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Nevertheless, recent studies have proposed that uncharacterized receptors located in endothelium have an opposite role to UNC5b in cell migration, which is dependent on dose/concentration of Netrin-1. The later leaves open the possibility that during a disease progression, levels of Netrin-1 might be modulated determining the severity of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>We also found expression of integrin &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1, a member of a large family of transmembrane proteins, which could be considered a non-classical receptor in HUVEC. However, this type of integrin has been defined as Netrin-4 receptor in lymphatic endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Due to the fact that HUVEC express Netrin-4, it is possible that &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;l may interact with this ligand in the fetal endothelium and, depending on dosage, play an anti-angiogenic role. Considering that umbilical cord remains in continuity with placenta, this idea is feasible since recently a group described that Netrin-4 inhibits cell proliferation and angiogenesis in placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p>Following the downstream pathway of Netrin-1, we evaluated the RhoA/ROCK contribution to Netrin-1 receptor activation in endothelial cells. Several reports have implicated RhoA/ROCK downstream signaling in response to Netrin-1 in neuronal migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Yet here we demonstrate that Netrin-1 can exert control of angiogenesis in an independent manner of RhoA/ROCK. Of note, we cannot rule out that at higher concentrations of exoenzyme C3 transferase, Netrin-1 might command through Rho/ROCK signaling. In fact, the later could be of importance given that Rho is not required for capillary tube formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, in this study they used a C3 transferase recombinant (3 &#x003bc;g/mL) for at least 18 h on commercially available HUVEC cell lines. It is noteworthy that we cannot discard Netrin-1 downstream signaling with other proteins including Fyn, FAK, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>To highlight the diversity of Netrin receptors that have been examined, a new receptor CD146 for Netrin-1 in endothelial cells was recently found to promote angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. CD146, also known as melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM), member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, cooperates in different biological processes including tumor metastasis, lymphocyte activation, and morphogenesis during development, and tissue regeneration. Thus, CD146 plays a critical role in cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation in endothelial cells. Tu and colleagues elegantly demonstrated an interaction between CD146 and Netrin-1. Nevertheless, here we show that HUVEC express low levels of Netrin-1 compared with Netrin-4. We speculate that Netrin-1&#x02019;s pro-angiogenic contribution rather comes from an adjacent cell present in the stroma, like WJ-MSC, which secrete more Netrin-1 than Netrin-4. Moreover, vascular endothelial cells are in direct contact with blood in the umbilical cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Hence, it is possible that HUVEC produce more Netrin-4 with anti-angiogenic effect to counteract the Netrin-1 secreted by WJ-MSC. This homeostasis could be imbalanced when the placenta vasculature undergoes dramatic blood vessel remodeling, as in pathological conditions related to pregnancy like IUGR, where Netrin-4 was found with higher expression than Netrin-1. Interestingly, coupled to this disease a derangement of placental vessel formation has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It is worth pointing out that diverse researchers have described that placenta can present structural and functional alterations in macrovasculature and microvasculature endothelium and have shown differential response to locally released molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Although these effects have been mainly attributed to the expression of classical angiogenic factors such as VEGF or FGF-2 by these cells, our results suggest that the influence of other less studied factors such as Netrin-1 cannot be ruled out. Collectively, our research demonstrates that WJ-MSC produce not only classical angiogenic factors such as VEGF, FGF-2 and EGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], but also Netrin-1 as pro-angiogenic regulators of HUVEC. Our results may have implications in the modulation of several pathological conditions related with placental angiogenesis dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Here we demonstrate that WJ-MSC-conditioned medium promotes angiogenesis and that this effect is partially mediated by Netrin-1 and independent of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway. This result reveals vital information for clinical approaches aimed at stimulating angiogenic processes. Further in-depth studies to elucidate Netrin-1 mechanism of action will shed light on the development of targeted therapies aiming to restore the physiological balance between Netrin-1, other proteins in the Netrin family and their receptors, for the desired therapeutic effect.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional file</title><p>
