Previous studies reported that autonomic activity plays a major role in social cognition and that difficulties in the ability to interpret social information are commonly observed in a variety of mental disorders, which in turn correlate with a poor autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation. It is well established that subjects with SCI have an alteration in ANS regulation mechanisms. We hypothesized that subjects diagnosed with SCI, who are experiencing a period of adaptation and socio-labor insertion suffer alterations in an emotion recognition task, a component of social cognition, which correlate with poor ANS regulation. We evaluated ANS function by measuring the heart rate variability (HRV) in 18 healthy subjects and 10 subjects with SCI. A 5-min baseline HRV was compared to a task period while performing The reading the mind in the eyes test (RMET). We found that while both groups have similar general performance in the test, healthy subjects responded with greater certainty during the RMET. This level of certainty during the RMET was positively correlated with baseline HRV measures in this group. Also, the group of healthy subjects exhibited higher HRV at baseline than participants with SCI. Finally, the changes in HRV between baseline and task condition were significantly higher in healthy individuals than in SCI participants. Our results show that patients with SCI have low levels of autonomic regulation mechanisms which may promote social cognition problems during their reinsertion to daily life.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>autonomic nervous system</kwd><kwd>social cognition</kwd><kwd>heart rate variability</kwd><kwd>spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>emotional processing</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Comisi&#x000f3;n Nacional de Investigaci&#x000f3;n Cient&#x000ed;fica y Tecnol&#x000f3;gica<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002848</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">Anillo ACT -66</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio P10-001-F</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio P09-015-F</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="42"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="6657"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating event that results in disturbances to normal sensory, motor, or autonomic function. This condition ultimately impacts a patient&#x02019;s physical, psychological and social well-being (Rossignol et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). SCI annual incidence and prevalence is high worldwide. In the United States, the prevalence is the highest, estimated in 906 per million, while the incidence in other countries varies between 49 per million in New Zealand, and 8 per million in Spain (Singh et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In most countries, the incidence of traumatic SCI is higher in people younger than 30 years old (Furlan et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), with a lifespan of over 15 years, which is associated with high personal and social costs (Priebe et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, some results of studies in people with SCI have impacted significantly on their health, physical capacity and quality of life. The pathophysiology of SCI in acute stages (Dietz, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), the impact of different types of therapies with stem cell transplantation (Valenzuela et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and the role of physical therapy in rehabilitation of people with SCI (Angeli et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) have been the subject topics of great interest in the last years. While these lines of research have contributed significantly to optimize the processes of rehabilitation related with impairment and activity limitations of people with SCI, other aspects of research related to social cognition and social participation have been less investigated. One of these issues relates to how changes in bodily responses and peripherical arousal, primarily determinate by autonomic activity, may affect emotional processing, which in turn, may have negative implications in SCI subjects social insertion processes (Inoue et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Appelhans and Luecken, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In this context, it has been reported that mood disorders in people with SCI are associated, in turn, with a variety of poorer outcomes including increased hospitalization periods, and secondary medical conditions, as well as decreased social integration quality of life, and self-care dependency (Munce et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>The perception and generation of responses to intentions and behaviors of others are known as social cognition (Green et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The recognition of facial expressions and the ability to infer the likely mental states of other people is known as Theory of Mind (TOM), an important topic of social cognition, which reflects deeply functional social capacity (Baron-Cohen et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Bora et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The emotions that people experience while interacting with their environment are related to constant physiological changes (Damasio et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). A key system involved in the generation of this physiological arousal is the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which is responsible for balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity (Berntson et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Appelhans and Luecken, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Rodrigues et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). One way used to explore the relationship between the ANS activity, and emotional processing is the analysis of Heart rate variability (HRV; Appelhans and Luecken, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). HRV is considered an effective tool to quantify the residual cardiovascular sympathovagal regulation after SCI and was highly reproducible in this population (Malmqvist et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Also, HRV analysis is emerging as an objective measure of regulated emotional response (appropriate timing and magnitude), and functions associated with social cognition and TOM (Pumprla et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Quintana et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>In the last years some studies have described that people with different types of psychiatric disorders such as autism (Van Hecke et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Bal et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), depression (Lee et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Kemp et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), and post-traumatic stress show alterations in the field of social cognition that correlate with a decrease in the HRV or imbalances in the autonomic regulation. A low HRV reflects an ANS that has a reduced ability to modify the influence of the sympathetic and parasympathetic system as required by a particular situation; that means a poor autonomic flexibility (Thayer and Lane, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>).</p><p>There is evidence that sympathetic cardiovascular control in SCI above spinal segment T6 is impaired or even absent (Malmqvist et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Consequently, cardiovascular disorders may occur such as reduced HRV, bradycardia, arterial hypotension and autonomic dysreflexia (Oh and Eun, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Serra-A&#x000f1;o et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Also, studies have shown that although sympathetic innervation is preserved in SCI patients below T6, there may be autonomic disorders, such as decreased parasympathetic influence in HRV (Bunten et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Claydon and Krassioukov, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Jan et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The aim of this study was to determine whether autonomic alteration of persons with SCI affects their performance in a social cognition task. We hypothesized that this type of basal activity of the ANS decreases autonomic flexibility that has been described as favorable for social cognition tasks. To test our hypothesis, HRV was measured as an autonomic marker, at rest and during the performance of the reading the mind in the eyes test (RMET). This later test assessed the affective component of the TOM, in healthy subjects and persons with SCI, who were experiencing a period of adaptation and socio-labor insertion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>We recruited 18 healthy subjects and 10 subjects with SCI ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) A and B, diagnosed with paraplegia, who were experiencing a period of adaption and socio-labor insertion (see demographics in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). All subjects with SCI had ended his rehabilitation process and were working or studying (period of adaptation and socio-labor insertion). Exclusion criteria included psychiatric illness diagnosed by psychology department of Los Coihues Clinic after application of Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), current use of antidepressants, the presence of autonomic dysreflexia in the last 6 months, and any other serious medical condition (e.g., cardiovascular disease).

All measurements were recorded between 15 and 18 pm. Participants are presented with 36 images of the eye region of different faces, providing four options for each image. Participants are instructed to answer each response as quickly as possible. After the response, the image was replaced by a gray screen and participants reported the certainty level of their responses, where 1 was unsure, 2 fairly sure, 3 very sure. The images were presented on a 21-inch (Viewsonic p815), with a distance between the subjects and the monitor of 57 cm. Each image was displayed without a time limit, and when participants had an answer, they pressed a button that turns the screen gray. At this moment, participants verbalized the answer and reported the certainty level of their responses. Then, the subjects pressed a button to trigger the next image presentation. The time required for the task was around of 1 h. The temperature of the room where the experiment was performed was 20&#x000b0;C.

The raw data was extracted from a text file and imported into Kubios (version 4.0, 2012, Biosignal Analysis And Medical Imaging Group, University of Kuopio, Finland, MATLAB). After a resting period of 5 min, a new 5-min quiet sitting period was acquired at the beginning of the assessment, to be used as the baseline HRV. Then, cardiac signals were acquired again during the performance of the RMET. Participants were breathing spontaneously during the recording period. The sitting position was chosen because, due to the extensive functional loss after SCI, affected individuals use a wheelchair and remain in the seated position most of the time (Serra-A&#x000f1;o et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>HRV was computed, as an autonomic marker, in all participants.

The frequency domain of HRV methods uses the power spectral density that measures how power distributes as a function of frequency (Malik et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). In the frequency domain, LF and HF mostly reflect sympathetic and vagal modulation of HRV, respectively (Pumprla et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Jan et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).

The changes in HRV during the RMET regarding baseline condition in the two groups of study are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>.

Anatomical injury level or residual motor and sensory function are not always indicative of the extent or pattern of autonomic failure (Bunten et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). In this context, it has long been described that autonomic disturbances in patients with SCI are mainly due to alterations of the sympathetic system, and that this sympathetic decentralization may cause a decreased capacity of the ANS rapid adaptation response to various environmental stimuli (Bunten et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Claydon and Krassioukov, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). However, to date, there have been few reports that investigate alterations in parasympathetic activity in patients with SCI and its impact on physical and cognitive functions. Some studies have described that parasympathetic cardiac autonomic dysfunction in people with SCI below T6 can occur due to immobility, associated with impairment of the venous pump of the paralyzed muscles, which in turn, is associated with confinement in a wheelchair and a sedentary lifestyle (Serra-A&#x000f1;o et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Spinal Cord Injury, Autonomic Nervous System and Social Cognition</title><p>It is well established that individuals with SCI are prone to mood disorders and psychiatric diseases during chronic stages of their condition (Craig et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>). And it has also been widely reported that autonomic alterations may contribute to the prevalence of these disorders (Bal et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Kemp et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In our work, the group of subjects with SCI had no psychiatric disorders, which was part of the inclusion criteria for the study, and also this group of people was in a chronic stage of their condition (more than a year after the lesion).</p><p>Research in cardiovascular activity and autonomic regulation suggests that parasympathetic activity is instrumental for the efficient functioning of the ANS in complex environments and during social cognition tasks (Thayer and Lane, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Park et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Our results show that persons with SCI have a decrement in autonomic flexibility, measured by HRV, and also confirms information reported in previous studies and allows us to say that autonomic activity, measured by HRV, can be considered as a biomarker for the ability of humans to recognize emotions in others (Pumprla et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Park et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>HRV reflects parasympathetic and sympathovagal activity, which is increased in healthy subjects and is correlated with better certainly during RMET. This conjunction of facts may be explained by two theoretical models; the polyvagal theory and the Neurovisceral integration model. These models suggest that through the activity of the vagal system and the prefrontal cortex respectively exerts an inhibitory influence on the sinoatrial node reducing its activity and favoring a physiological resting state (increase HRV). This has been considered as favorable for interaction with the environment and social cognition functions (Thayer and Lane, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Amodio and Frith, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavioral Performance</title><p>Despite the fact that subjects with SCI had a similar performance in the task compared with the healthy subjects, there was a low level of certain responses in the group of persons with SCI compared to control group. It is important to note that while subjects performed the task they had no feedback associated with their performance, so they did not know if their answer was correct or not. The fact that the subject should report the level of certainty in the responses represented the subject&#x02019;s subjective feeling about its performance and comfort level with the test, in this regard subject that expresses some degree of difficulty in performing this task, which assesses the affective component of the TOM, will respond with less certainty compared with a subject that feel comfortable during the test. We think that these low levels of certainty showed by subjects with SCI during RMET, reflects social cognition problems which may increase during stress situations. In this context it has been reported that the probability of having mood disorders is associated with high level of anxiety and low levels of self-efficacy, that is related to the confidence in their own ability to complete the task and reach goals (Munce et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Contrary to expectation, the ability of subjects to recognize the emotional state showed in the pictures during the test was similar in both groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Previous reports have shown that low levels of parasympathetic activity (measured by HRV) is correlated with poor performance in tasks that assess topics related to social cognition (Lee et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Bal et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Kemp et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Quintana et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). However, it is important to note that most of the studies that have linked social cognition and HRV have been reported in subjects with psychiatric disorders, which could increase the behavioral difference between patients and controls.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Differences in the Mechanism of Autonomic Regulation between Persons with SCI and Healthy Subjects</title><p>The fact that the group of subjects with SCI presents a significantly lower sympathovagal activity than the healthy population suggests that this group of people will have limitations in autonomic flexibility which may affect their ability to generate a functional autonomic balance in different situations (Rodrigues et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). For the other side, the group of healthy subjects changes their sympathovagal activity significantly during the execution of the RMET regarding the resting condition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), which it was not observed in the group of subjects with SCI (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). These findings suggest that autonomic activity in healthy subjects compared to subjects with SCI is regulated differently during an emotion recognition task. These results are consistent with outcomes reported by studies that have promoted the use of drugs in psychotherapy that favors improvements in different topics of social cognition. These studies indicate that bounded dose of 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) optimize functions related to social cognition through a depressed activity of the amygdala (Bedi et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), increased levels of the hormone oxytocin (Dumont et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), decreased sympathetic activity and parasympathetic activity increased (Frye et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>It has been estimated that around 55% of SCI subjects have difficulties in social participation (Craig et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>), is not clear which aspects are related to the ability of subjects to get over to this condition, but some aspects such as self-efficacy and low levels of negative moods contribute to resilience associated with increased level of well-being (Craig et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>; Guest et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). For the other side, anxiety, secondary complications, cognitive impairment, premorbid psychological disorder are related with both social stress and humor disorders, but other neurophysiological aspects such as autonomic flexibility have been poured described (Craig et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>). The different sympathovagal response but the similarity in the behavioral performance observed between control, and SCI subjects could be associated with low demands gathered by the test used. The lower certainty levels reported by SCI subjects during the social cognition task could be related to the difficulty to make autonomic regulation in response to environmental stimuli, which in turn can be caused by a malfunction of cortical networks linked with social cognition functions (Neurovisceral integration model). These results allow us to suggest that autonomic disturbances may affect important cognitive functions for adaptation and social reintegration, which corresponds to a fundamental stage in the rehabilitation process of patients with SCI.</p><p>We also consider some limitation of our study. First, although we obtained statistically significant results and the size effect was large, a large number of SCI subjects would have been desirable to compare with the larger number of controls. Also, because there is no control for the RMET task, the low level of certainty may be a general aspect of individuals with SCI, and the significance of this fact was not evaluated. Finally, broader aspects of social cognition were not included thus no contextualization of this particular feature in no possible here.</p><p>Different models have been proposed to explain the contribution of ANS to emotional processing and how HRV reflect higher cognitive functions as social cognition. The polyvagal theory and the Neurovisceral Integration model (Thayer and Lane, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) propose that the ANS, through prefrontal and vagal tone activity, favor an adequate interaction between a subject and their environment. This influence is achieved through an inhibitory effect on the sino-atrial node (Appelhans and Luecken, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) with a critical role for parasympathetically mediated inhibition of autonomic arousal in emotional expression. This modulation could be observed throughout the HRV measures, which is informative about individuals capacity for regulated emotional responding and functions related to social cognition (Lane et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Thayer and Lane, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Quintana et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>The neurovisceral integration model focuses on the inhibitory role of the prefrontal cortex and their contribution to modulate cardiovascular function through parasympathetic vagal pathways (Thayer and Lane, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). This model establishes the idea that some topics of cognitive and emotional function could be observed throughout HRV measures (Thayer and Lane, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). To explain this fact, the neurovisceral integration model describes that the prefrontal, cingulate and insula cortices form an interconnected network with bi-directional communication with the amygdala (Thayer and Lane, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Quintana et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The amygdala is under tonic inhibitory control via prefrontal vagal pathways to intercalated cells. Impairment in the prefrontal cortex&#x02014;for example in depression or autism&#x02014;leads to disinhibition of the central nucleus of the amygdala and medullary cardio acceleratory circuits, thus leading to increased heart rhythm and decreased HRV. In this way, HRV may be related to social cognition given its relationship with activity in prefrontal neural structures (Lane et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Thayer and Lane, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Quintana et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Coda</title><p>In summary, this research provides direct evidence to support the relationship between ANS&#x02019; function and emotion recognition, a facet of social cognition, in subjects with SCI.
