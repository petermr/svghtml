    "This paper explores the ethical implications of a randomized double-blind clinical trial aimed to determine effectiveness and safety of an oxytocin receptor antagonist versus a betamimetic in the treatment of preterm labor, presented to a teaching hospital affiliated with a private university in Santiago, Chile. Though this trial protocol fulfills one of the conditions under which pregnant women could be enrolled in a clinical trial-the intervention has the potential to benefit the pregnant woman (by reducing adverse effects associated to salbutamol administration) and her fetus (if the new drug prolongs pregnancy)-there are some specific ethical issues raised. First, when to obtain consent is an important issue for clinical trials involving acute and unforeseen conditions that affect pregnant woman, e.g. preterm labor. Second, research must address the risk/benefit ratio for these two interdependent individuals, providing a good prospect of low risk and adequate benefit for both of them. Thirdly, specifically when a study is sponsored by a high-income country and conducted in a low- or middle-income country, decisions regarding ancillary care provisions for research participants should be made in advance. Lastly, researchers must consider the requirements for paternal consent based on cultural contexts."
