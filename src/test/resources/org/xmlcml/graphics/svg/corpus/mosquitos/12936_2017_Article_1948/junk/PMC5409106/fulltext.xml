Repeated exposure to unpredictable and uncontrollable stressors may result in brain modifications that decrease the capacity to appropriately respond to subsequent stressors, thus increasing the risk for developing mental disorders, including depression (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">McEwen and Gianaros, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, several studies have shown that functional modifications of the hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and other structures are responsible for depression symptoms (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Drevets et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Price and Drevets, 2010</xref>). The hippocampus, a stress-sensitive limbic structure, is crucial for episodic and spatial memory; these functions are impaired in depressive disorder (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Austin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Drevets et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Price and Drevets, 2010</xref>). Human brain imaging and preclinical studies in rodents have revealed that stress and depression are associated with reduced hippocampal volume, neuronal atrophy, and dendritic spine loss (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">McEwen and Seeman, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Vyas et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez-Guasti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Castaneda et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, the hippocampus participates in the intersection between cognition and emotion and plays a crucial in the pathophysiology of mood disorders (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Campbell and Macqueen, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Femen&#x000ed;a et al., 2012</xref>). Similar to other studies (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Bondi et al., 2008</xref>), we previously reported that chronic stress in rodents produces anhedonia, impairs associative learning, and increases immobility in the forced swimming test (FST) (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Bravo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Ulloa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Castaneda et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, these behavioral modifications are accompanied by dendritic atrophy and spine density reduction of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">McEwen and Seeman, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Vyas et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez-Guasti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Castaneda et al., 2015</xref>). Overall, this evidence suggests that the mechanisms involved in excitatory synapse formation and maintenance can be altered in stress-related mood disorders, contributing to the phenotypic alterations observed in depressive disorder.</p><p>The formation and elimination of dendritic spines are mechanisms by which neuronal connections can be shaped (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Chklovskii et al., 2004</xref>). The growth of dendrites, filopodia, and dendritic spines occurs by protrusive forces of actin polymerization (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Luo, 2002</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that the morphological alterations observed under chronic stress are produced by changes in signal transduction pathways that target the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Members of the Rho-GTPase family regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics and modulate axonal growth, dendritic arborization, and spine growth during development and adulthood (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Luo, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Nakayama et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Tashiro and Yuste, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Govek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Elia et al., 2006</xref>). For instance, activated RacGTP-ases stimulate the formation of thin spines (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Nakayama et al., 2000</xref>) and through the activation of p21-activated kinase 1 trigger the activation of LIM-kinase, which phosphorylates and inhibits cofilin, a potent actin-depolymerizing molecule (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Calabrese et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, RhoA-GTPases promote neuronal dendritic arbor simplification and reduce spine length and number (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Nakayama et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Nakayama and Luo, 2000</xref>). RhoA signaling is mediated by Rho serine/threonine kinase (ROCK) isoforms 1 and 2, the latter being highly expressed in the brain and muscle tissue (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Hashimoto et al., 1999</xref>). ROCK regulates cytoskeleton dynamics by phosphorylation of the myosin light chain (MLC) at Ser19, probably facilitating acto-myosin interaction (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Hirose et al., 1998</xref>), which may produce fast neuronal remodeling, such as retraction of dendrites. Furthermore, ROCK can phosphorylate and inactivate the myosin phosphatase-targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1) of MLC phosphatase and may indirectly increase MLC phosphorylation state, favoring acto-myosin interaction (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Amano et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Studies have shown high immunoreactivity of ROCK2 in several brain areas, including pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Hashimoto et al., 1999</xref>), suggesting a particular role of ROCK in these structures of the adult brain. Although ROCK2-deficient mice display normal brain anatomy, electrophysiological studies in hippocampal slices evidenced an impairment of both basal synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (<xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). These electrophysiological alterations were consistent with modifications in dendritic spine length and morphology, accompanied by an increase in activated cofilin (unphosphorylated form). Nonetheless, this study did not explore whether the deletion of ROCK2 modifies the behavior of animals (<xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Considering that ROCK has several downstream effectors and that some of them are related to the regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics, studies have evaluated the effect of different ROCK inhibitors on brain function. For example, in vascular smooth cells, Fasudil increases cerebral blood flow after stroke by reducing vasoconstriction (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Shin et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, systemic administration of hydroxyfasudil, an active metabolite of Fasudil, improves the cognitive deficits in aged rats and also improves learning and memory in a model of sporadic Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Hou et al., 2012</xref>). According to the relevance of the Rho-ROCK pathway in neuronal morphology in vitro and the effect of ROCK inhibitors on cognition, learning, and memory, it is particularly important to address whether RhoA signaling is being altered under some pathological conditions, such as depressive disorders. Recently, in an animal model of depression induced by chronic restraint stress, we observed an increase in hippocampal phospho-MYPT1 levels, suggesting that ROCK2 is activated by this experimental paradigm (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Castaneda et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the rise in phospho-MYPT1 levels was associated with the spine loss observed in secondary dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Castaneda et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that bilateral infralimbic administration of Y-27632, a specific ROCK inhibitor, promotes antidepressant-like effects in naive rats that are similar to those produced by the antidepressant fluoxetine (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Inan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Considering that stress increases immobility in the FST, an effect that is accompanied by a dendrite spine loss in CA1 pyramidal neurons and along with an increase in hippocampal phospho-MYPT1 levels, indicative of RhoA-ROCK pathway activation (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Castaneda et al., 2015</xref>), we hypothesized that pharmacological inhibition of ROCK with Fasudil prevents both the increase in immobility in FST and dendrite spine loss in the hippocampus of rats under chronic restraint stress paradigm, an animal model of depression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Animals</title><p>The Sprague-Dawley rats used in these experiments were obtained from the Faculty of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universidad de Chile. Efforts were made to minimize the number of animals and their suffering. The rats were handled according to guidelines outlined and approved by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universidad de Chile and the Science and Technology National Commission (CONICYT), in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication, 8th Edition, 2011).</p><p>The adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250&#x02013;280 g) were housed in groups of 4/cage in a temperature (22&#x02013;23&#x000ba;C) and humidity (55&#x02013;65%) controlled room with a standard light: dark cycle (12 hours:12 hours). Food (standard rat chow) and water were freely provided, except when restraint stress was applied. The rats were handled once per day for 7 days prior to initiating the experimental procedures. The handling procedure consisted of picking up the rat by its body, weighing it, and finally returning it to its home cage.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Restraint Stress and Pharmacological Treatment</title><p>An animal model of chronic restraint stress was used to evaluate changes in ROCK activity and the effect of the ROCK inhibitor Fasudil on behavior. A dose of 10 mg/kg i.p. was selected based on the observation that i.p. administration of 5 to 15 mg/kg of Fasudil was previously reported to induce neuroprotection in the CNS (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2014</xref>). The rats were randomly assigned to weight-matched groups that received one of the following treatments prior to the restraint protocol: (1) unstressed control animals injected every day for 18 days with saline (0.9% NaCl) (CONTROL, n=16) or with 10 mg/kg Fasudil (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) (FASUDIL, n = 13), and (2) stressed animals injected for 18 days with saline (STRESS, n = 16) or 10 mg/kg Fasudil (STRESS-FASUDIL, n=15). All injections were carried out i.p. 15 minutes prior to the stress protocol. To examine the preventive action of Fasudil on chronic stress effects, the stress procedure was initiated 4 days after the first drug or saline was administered. In this study, we used restraint stress as previously described, which consisted of placing the rats in Plexiglas tubes (25 x 8 cm) that were wide enough to allow comfortable breathing but restricting the movement of the animals for 2.5 h/d for 14 consecutive days. Every stress session was performed between 9:00 <sc>am</sc> and 12:00 <sc>pm</sc> to avoid any effects due to changes in circadian rhythms. After the procedure, the animals were returned to their respective cages. After vehicle or Fasudil administration, unstressed animals were maintained in their home cages and left in another room. Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, animals were evaluated in a behavioral test (described below) or were killed to obtain either brain tissue to conduct morphological analyses, or the hippocampus for protein level determinations by immuno-western blot.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>FST</title><p>The behavioral test consisted of blinded observations, which was carried out 24 hours after the last restraint procedure, in a quiet room. This test was performed as previously described (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Lucki, 1997</xref>). A transparent Plexiglas cylinder (50 cm high x 20 cm wide) was filled up to a depth of 30 cm with water at 24&#x000ba;C. Four hours after the last stress session and Fasudil treatment on day 14, rats were trained for 15 minutes by placing them in the water-filled cylinder. On day 15 (24 hours after cessation of stress and Fasudil treatment), the rats were subjected to 5 minutes of forced swimming and escape behaviors (climbing and swimming) that were registered by trained observers who were blind to the treatments. Climbing was defined as upward-directed movements of the forepaws along the side of the swim chamber, while swimming consisted of movements throughout the swim chamber. Duration of immobility was defined as the time the animal was not actively involved in escape responses (i.e., total time of the test minus the time the animal spent climbing or swimming).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Golgi Staining and Evaluation of Dendritic Spine Density</title><p>After decapitation, one brain hemisphere was used for morphological studies and in the other, the hippocampus was dissected and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. The FD Rapid GolgiStain kit (FD Neuro Technologies, Baltimore, MD) was used as recently described (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Castaneda et al., 2015</xref>). Secondary apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons from the CA1 region were selected for spine analyses (bregma -2.3 to -4.3) (<xref rid="CIT0040a" ref-type="bibr">Paxinos and Watson, 1982</xref>). The criteria for the selection of Golgi-impregnated neurons for morphological analyses were recently described (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Castaneda et al., 2015</xref>). Confocal <italic>z</italic>-stacks of identified intersections were captured on a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal laser scanning microscope. Each designated segment was located in the microscope field, and confocal stacks of 15 to 30 digital images, separated by a <italic>z</italic>-step of 0.5 to 1 &#x003bc;m, were captured using a Plan-Apochromat 40 &#x000d7; 1.4 NA Zeiss oil-immersion objective. Protrusions in direct connection with the dendritic shaft, irrespective of their morphological characteristics, were considered as spines. A mushroom spine type was identified when its head diameter exceeded 0.6 &#x003bc;m; the remaining spines (filopodia, stubby and other protrusions) were classified as &#x0201c;non-mushroom.&#x0201d; Spines were counted in segments of 8 &#x000b5;m, starting from the origin of the branch, along a distance of 80 &#x000b5;m of the secondary dendrite. The number of spines at a given distance from the origin of the branch were then averaged using all of the neurons from the same animal (at least 6 cells/animal), and these data were pooled with the mean of the other animals belonging to the same experimental group. The total number of spines corresponded to the sum of spines along the dendritic length of 80 &#x000b5;m.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Immunoblot Analysis</title><p>Whole hippocampus was homogenized in a glass-glass homogenizer in the presence of 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.125 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 0.2 mM PMSF, 2 &#x000b5;g/mL leupeptin, 2 &#x003bc;g/mL aprotinin, 2 mM NaF, 0.25 mM Na<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, and 1% Triton X-100 and then sonicated on ice for 5 minutes. After centrifuging lysates at 17860 x g for 30 minutes, the supernatant was collected and a sample was saved for protein determination using the bicinchoninic method (Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit ThermoFisher Scientific). The remaining supernatant was boiled immediately in sample loading buffer. A total of 25 to 50 &#x003bc;g of each protein extract was resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then blotted onto 0.2 &#x003bc;m nitrocellulose (for detection of total and phosphorylated form of LIMK and MYPT1) or 0.2 &#x003bc;m PVDF membranes (for determination of total and phosphorylated form of cofilin).

All membranes were then incubated with enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) and detected by a chemiluminescence imager (Syngene). Band intensities were determined and analyzed using the UN SCAN IT software. The levels of &#x003b2;-actin were used to verify equivalent protein loading.

Stress exposure may contribute to the development of depression (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Kendler et al., 1999</xref>), and several studies support the idea that stress-induced brain atrophy might be responsible, in part, for the phenotypic characteristics of depressive disorders (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Pittenger and Duman, 2008</xref>). The observed morphological changes include dendritic tree simplification accompanied by a reduction in the number of dendritic spines (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Koleske, 2010</xref>). We have recently described that dendritic spine loss in the hippocampus of chronically stressed rats is related to an increase in phospho-MYPT1, a well-known downstream target of ROCK, suggesting that stress promotes the activation of the RhoA-ROCK pathway and therefore induces changes in cytoskeleton dynamics (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Castaneda et al., 2015</xref>). Our main findings in the present study performed in rats can be summarized as follows: Fasudil, a ROCK inhibitor, prevents the stress-induced immobility observed in the FST, spine loss in CA1 neurons of the hippocampus, and increase in pMYPT1 levels.</p><p>By using a chronic restraint stress paradigm in rats, we have previously reported anhedonic behavior accompanied by a significant reduction in escape-directed behavior (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Bravo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Castaneda et al., 2015</xref>). In the present study, we tested the effect of Fasudil in the FST, a test widely used to assess antidepressant activity of pharmacological agents (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Porsolt et al., 1979</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Cryan et al., 2005</xref>). It has been described that all antidepressant drugs reduce behavioral immobility. However, those antidepressants that increase serotonergic neurotransmission predominantly increase swimming behavior, whereas those that increase catecholaminergic neurotransmission increase climbing behavior (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Cryan et al., 2005</xref>). We demonstrated that Fasudil treatment reduced stress-induced immobility through an increase in active responses, mainly in climbing behavior, to a level that was even higher than in control rats. Notably, the effect of Fasudil in stressed animals resembles the action of the antidepressant DMI (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Bravo et al., 2009</xref>), which blocks the norepinephrine transporter. However, in our model, we do not know whether chronically administered Fasudil modifies noradrenergic neurotransmission. Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that acute bilateral microinjection of the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (0.25 &#x003bc;g) into the infralimbic cortex of na&#x000ef;ve rats increased active behavior during the FST (swimming and climbing) (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Inan et al., 2015</xref>), similarly to drugs with dual effects on norepinephrine and serotonin transporters that extend the duration of both active behaviors (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Detke et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Thus, it seems plausible that drugs that do not share the same pharmacological profile, that is, antidepressant molecules and ROCK inhibitors, may converge into a common intracellular pathway that underlies the action of antidepressants. The specificity of the FST for screening antidepressant-like agents has been widely questioned (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Petit-Demouliere et al., 2005</xref>), because a large variety of nonantidepressant drugs have been shown to increase the locomotion that can be erroneously interpreted with an antidepressant-like effect (for review, see Yin et al., 2016). For this reason, some studies that evaluate the effects of antidepressant drugs in FST also evaluate potential hyperactivity in the open field arena. Although we did not use parallel test to exclude drug-induced locomotor false positives, there is a report indicating that Fasudil did not change locomotor activity in the open field test (<xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Yoshimi et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, we have observed that the total arm visits in elevated plus-maze was similar in control and stressed animals with or without Fasudil administration, suggesting that treatments did not alter locomotor activity (data not shown).</p><p>On the other hand, studies have used FST to visualize the &#x0201c;depressogenic effect&#x0201d; of various types of stress; however, their effects seem to be dependent on the stress paradigm used (for review, see <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Bogdanova et al., 2013</xref>). Some authors have proposed that the immobility observed during the test session of the FST indicates that the animal &#x0201c;learned&#x0201d; a strategy to save energy during the FST training session. Thus, in this scenario, the increase in the time spent in immobility does not seem to be related to &#x0201c;behavioral despair&#x0201d; or depressive-like symptoms (for review, see <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">de Kloet and Molendijk, 2016</xref>). Considering that in our stress model Fasudil increases the time spent in climbing in the FST, the increment in this active response may be indicative of changes in the activity of some neural circuits related to this behavior promoted by the ROCK inhibitor. In the context of depressive behavior, motivation has been evaluated by the exposure of rodents to an inescapable stressor, such as the tail-suspension test or FST, and quantifying the proportion of time spent performing escape-related behavior (struggling) relative to time spent immobile. Recently, and by using an optogenetic approach, acute and selective inhibition of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons was shown to promote several depression-like behaviors, such as anhedonia (sucrose consumption) and reduced struggling behavior in the tail-suspension test (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Tye et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, this study also showed that the phasic activation of VTA dopaminergic neurons reverts the reduction in escape behavior (struggling) induced by chronic mild stress (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Tye et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, other optogenetic approaches revealed that a selective population of neurons in medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in the active response to behavioral challenges (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Warden et al., 2012</xref>). More recently, optogenetic approaches have also shown that activation of the ventral-hippocampus-medial PFC pathway is required for the sustained action of ketamine antidepressant action, observed as an increase in climbing in the FST (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Carreno et al., 2016</xref>). Although a similar mechanism probably operates in our stress model, the suggested Fasudil antidepressant action in the FST must be interpreted with caution, and further studies are required to prove its action on specific circuits that are sensitive to stress, such as those related to motivated behavior.</p><p>Structural neuronal changes within the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex are increasingly recognized as key to the pathophysiology of depression (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Pittenger and Duman, 2008</xref>). A reduction in spine densities in CA1 neurons has been associated with depression-like behaviors in several animal models of depression induced by restraint stress or by chronic exposure to light at night, suggesting an altered glutamatergic excitatory neurotransmission in the hippocampus (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Bedrosian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez-Guasti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Castaneda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). Some studies have reported that antidepressant drugs with different primary mechanisms of action such as imipramine and fluoxetine (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Bessa et al., 2009</xref>) revert both behavioral deficits and spine loss in CA3 (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Bessa et al., 2009</xref>) caused by stress. Accordingly, we next analyzed the potential contribution of Fasudil on dendritic spine density that may explain its stress preventive effect on depression-like behaviors. Thus, in the present study, we found that stress-induced spine loss (nonmushroom spines) in secondary dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons was prevented by Fasudil treatment, suggesting that ROCK inhibition and perhaps other kinases can modify spine density. Recently, it was shown that primary hippocampal neurons acutely exposed to Y-27632, a ROCK inhibitor, specifically increased the number of &#x0fb01;lopodia and thin spines (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Swanger et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, this evidence suggests that ROCK inhibition promotes variation in the density of spines, mainly the immature forms.</p><p>The effect of Fasudil may be related to modulation of the cytoskeleton in vivo that favors spine stability, an effect that correlates well with the observed antidepressant-like action of this drug in stressed animals. In accordance with this, ROCK directly phosphorylates MLC, at least in vitro (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Amano et al., 1996</xref>), and probably favors actomyosin interaction and contraction. In addition, some studies have indicated that ROCK activates the LIMK-cofilin pathway (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Maekawa et al., 1999</xref>), but we found that phosphorylation levels of this kinase are insensitive to stress and Fasudil treatment. Moreover, ROCK2 activity may indirectly increase the level of phospho-MLC by phosphorylating the Thr853 residue of the MLC phosphatase regulator MYPT1 (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Hartshorne et al., 1998</xref>; Somlyo and <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Somlyo, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Somlyo et al., 2000</xref>), resulting in a decrease in MLC phosphatase activity (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Kimura et al., 1996</xref>). Recently, we reported a rise in phospho-MYPT1 levels in the hippocampus of stressed animals and considering that this protein is an exclusive target of ROCK (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Grassie et al., 2011</xref>), we suggested that chronic stress activates ROCK (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Castaneda et al., 2015</xref>). The present study showed that both factors, increased phospho-MYPT1 levels and reduced spine density triggered by chronic stress, are prevented by Fasudil, suggesting that this drug may mediate those effects by inhibiting ROCK activity.</p><p>Overall, this evidence suggests that the disruption of the Rho-ROCK pathway and/or inhibition of other kinases by Fasudil seem to exert antidepressant-like actions, probably by preventing spine loss in some areas (e.g., hippocampus). However, further studies are necessary to confirm whether Fasudil acts on similar substrates in different brain areas. We should also consider that Fasudil, through the inhibition of ROCK, may affect several transduction pathways. In vivo reports have shown that i.p. administration of Fasudil in a dose similar to the present study (10 mg/kg) implicated ROCK in the negative regulation of PTEN activity and the enhancement of AKT activity, a neuroprotective transduction pathway (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, many new effects of Fasudil have been described, particularly in the CNS. It has been shown that systemic administration of Fasudil protects against ischemia (15 mg/kg) (<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2014</xref>) and attenuates neuronal apoptosis and proinflammatory cytokine production (5&#x02013;10 mg/kg) (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2013</xref>) in animals models of neurodegeneration. Interestingly, diverse evidences have situated neuroinflammation and proinflammatory cytokines as principal players in depressive disorder pathogenesis and recurrence (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Slavich and Irwin, 2014</xref>). Thus, it remains to be elucidated whether Fasudil, through its antidepressant-like actions and preventive effect on dendritic spine loss, are related to ROCK inhibition or to other kinases sensitive to this drug and/or are associated with modulatory effects on glial and inflammatory cells in the CNS. However, considering that systemic administration of Fasudil may act as a potent vasodilator, it will be important to consider this action in vivo, which may mediate not only effects on peripheral organs but also cause protective effects in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study suggests that Fasudil could prevent both increase in immobility in the FST and spine loss induced by chronic restraint stress in the rat hippocampus. Although further experiments are necessary to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying the Fasudil-induced improvement in activity level in the FST and spine loss prevention, the present results can be considered as an initial step by providing support for the hypothesis that ROCK inhibition initiates a cascade of events that can prevent stress-induced behavior and spine loss. Finally, our findings offer new perspectives on pharmacological intervention in depressive disorders.</p></sec><sec><title>Statement of Interest</title><p>None.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to Constanza Fuentealba for technical assistance.
