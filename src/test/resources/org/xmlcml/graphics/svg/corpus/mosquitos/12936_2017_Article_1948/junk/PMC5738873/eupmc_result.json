    "To evaluate the impact of the implementation of insertion and maintenance bundles on the rates of catheter-related bloodstream infection in an intensive care unit.This is a quasi-experimental, before-and-after study with a non-equivalent control group. During a six-month period, insertion and maintenance bundles for the central venous catheters were implemented. Supervision guidelines were developed to assess compliance with the bundle and catheter characteristics.A total of 444 central catheters corresponding to 390 patients were observed, of which 68.7% were inserted in the unit. The maintenance and insertion bundles reached 62.9% and 94.7% compliance, respectively, and 50.7% of the insertions were supervised. It was possible to observe a 54.5% decrease in the rate of central catheter infection (3.48 vs 1.52 x 1000 days/catheter, p<0.05) when compared with the control group.The simultaneous implementation of insertion and maintenance bundles has a positive impact on the reduction of catheter-related bloodstream infection; therefore it is an efficient alternative to improve the quality and safety of care in high complexity units."
