A recent review conducted by Barbosa and de Oliveira of 7 studies measuring PA of preschool children during school time, showed the proportion of MVPA was only 3.3% of school time in 4&#x02013;5&#x000a0;y old children (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Barbosa and Oliveira, 2016</xref>)</p><p>Chilean children engage in little total PA and excessive levels of sedentary behavior. According to the 2016 Report Card on Physical Activity and Youth, which graded several indicators on PA and sedentary behavior, Chilean children ranked among the lowest 30% globally and assigned an overall grade of F (fail) (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Aguilar-Farias et al., 2016</xref>). While data on Chilean preschool children are sparse, a study of 6&#x02013;9&#x000a0;y old children in a low-income district of Santiago, found that only 25% and 14% of children met the guideline for PA on weekdays and weekend days, respectively (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Moreno et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Given the need for increased PA among children, the Ministry of Sports initiated a nationwide program in 2014 to increase PA and sports participation among low-income schoolchildren between the ages of 3 and 14 y. This program includes an intervention component targeting 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;y olds attending preschool children in both public elementary schools and kindergartens for half or full day: &#x0201c;Active Preschools&#x0201d; or Jard&#x000ed;n Activo (JA program). This program provides funding for certified physical education (PE) teachers to lead recommended three structured PE lessons (JA lessons) per week of 45 or 60&#x000a0;min each, for at least 7&#x000a0;months of the school year.</p><p>To achieve JA's general objective of increasing PA, the Ministry of Sports instructs teachers through an on- line session of 1&#x000a0;h, to strengthen basic motor skills, using active play while addressing gender differences. In 2015, there were a total of 533 JA programs nationwide; of these 311 targeted preschool children in 92 schools (around 7500 participants) (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Government of Chile, Minister of Sports, 2015</xref>)</p><p>The aim of this study is to determine a) the effectiveness of the JA program in terms of its contribution to MVPA during school time, and b) if effectiveness of the JA program varies according to school schedule.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methodology</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p>The study sample consists of preschool children in elementary schools. Because the 92 schools could house more than one JA program, we selected only one per school, as the same PE teacher taught all JA lessons. Sixty six schools from 28 districts located in 8 Regions (Chile has 15 Regions and 334 districts) met inclusion criteria of: a) agreeing to participate b) being logistically feasible for ten-week data collection and c) represent the urban/rural distribution of low income Chileans.

Indeed, the proportion of MVPA accrued in half day and full day was the same, 12.8 and 12.4% of MVPA, respectively (not shown).</p><p>Research shows that young children engage in limited MVPA during school time. Recently, Crosatti et al. analyzed PA in 370 children aged 4 to 6&#x000a0;years during school, and reported that children spent most of their time in sedentary behaviors (89.6%&#x02013;90.9%) (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Sara et al., 2014</xref>). Pagels et al1 found that 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;y olds, engaged in MVPA for only 16.3&#x000a0;min or 3.8% of school time (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Pagels et al., 2011</xref>).

Although the recommendation is that 50% lesson time be spent on MVPA, minutes of MVPA accrued in physical activity during the lesson was considerably greater than other daily time periods in and out of school (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">US Department of Health and Human Services, 2000</xref>).</p><p>A study that is similar to ours was done by Van Cauwenberghe et al. and included 200 Belgian preschool children (5.3&#x000a0;y) (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Van Cauwenberghe et al., 2013</xref>). It characterized PA levels with accelerometers during days with teacher-led PE lesson and days without. The mean PE lesson length was 49&#x000a0;min. Results showed that in PE days, sedentary time was 39.4&#x000a0;min and MVPA was 44.2&#x000a0;min, while in non PE days, these figures were 49.7&#x000a0;min and 34&#x000a0;min respectively, demonstrating that PE lessons contributed significantly to the decrease in sedentary time and the increase in MVPA during school time. Vale et al. in a similar study including Portuguese preschoolers showed that in PE days, boys accumulated 7 and girls 6 more min in MVPA. In comparison, in our study we showed that during full time schedule (approximately the same school time), children accumulated 12 more min of MVPA (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Vale et al., 2011</xref>)</p><p>The most important strength of this study is that it not only shows that a nationwide program is effective in significantly increasing MVPA during school time, but that in full day attendance, the effect is greater. One limitation of the study is that PA was only assessed during the time children attended school, therefore we do not know how much MVPA children accumulated outside of school, and therefore cannot compare if children complied or not with the daily MVPA recommendation. Although we were not able to select a random sample due to time constraints, we collected data in 10&#x000a0;weeks on 8% of children targeted nationwide from 71.7% of the schools which housed JA programs.</p><p>In conclusion, JA days were associated with significantly greater time spent in MVPA (vs. non JA days) among preschool children during school time, especially when they attend school full time. The observed effect is meaningful given the importance of PA in early childhood, where even 10&#x000a0;min of additional vigorous PA may confer substantial benefits to bone mineral content, among other health outcomes (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Janz et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Timmons et al., 2007</xref>). Though our results suggest the JA program was effective, a cluster-randomized controlled trial may deliver conclusive evidence. Because girls are considerably less active, we recommend investigating the causes of gender disparities developing practical solutions to reverse this trend. Finally, we recommend the JA program to standardize the structure of the JA lesson, in terms of the types and duration of activities taught.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aguilar-Farias</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cortinez-O'Ryan</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sadarangani</surname><given-names>K.P.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Results from Chile's 2016 report card on physical activity for children and youth</article-title><source>J.
