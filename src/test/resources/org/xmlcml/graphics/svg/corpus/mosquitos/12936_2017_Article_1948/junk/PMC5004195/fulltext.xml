Combining electrophysiology, immunostaining and genetic manipulation at the pre and postsynaptic compartments we study the DLG contribution to the basal synaptic-function at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuromuscular junction. Our results reveal a specific function of DLGS97 in the regulation of the size of GLUR fields and their subunit composition. Strikingly the absence of any of DLG proteins at the presynaptic terminal disrupts the clustering and localization of the calcium channel DmCa1A subunit (Cacophony), decreases the action potential-evoked release probability and alters short-term plasticity.

The discs-large proteins (DLG) are a subfamily of the Membrane Associated Guanylate Kinase (MAGUK) widely expressed in the nervous system and conserved across the animal kingdom<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. In vertebrates, there are four <italic>dlg</italic>-MAGUK genes; <italic>dlg1</italic> (<italic>sap97/hdlg</italic>), <italic>dlg2</italic> (<italic>sap102</italic>/<italic>neuroendocrine discs large</italic>), <italic>dlg3</italic> (<italic>psd93</italic>/ch<italic>apsyn-11</italic>0) and <italic>dlg4</italic> (<italic>psd95</italic>/<italic>sap90</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Although all members of the DLG family are expressed in the post-synaptic density, their enrichment is variable. Notably, all of them are also expressed at different levels in the axon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, however, the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of DLG in presynaptic function has not been determined.</p><p><italic>dlg1</italic> is the only gene of the DLG-MAGUK subfamily in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Similar to vertebrate genes, two forms of the gene are expressed as the result of two transcription start sites. DLGA (&#x003b1; form) and DLGS97 (&#x003b2; form) are distinguished by the inclusion of an L27 domain in beta forms located in the amino terminus of the protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In vertebrates DLG4/PSD95 is predominantly expressed as &#x003b1; form while DLG1/SAP97 is mainly expressed as &#x003b2; form. DLGA is expressed in epithelial tissues, somatic muscle and neurons; in turn, DLGS97 is not expressed in the epithelial tissue. In the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a glutamatergic synapse, both <italic>dlg</italic> products are expressed pre and postsynaptically<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Hypomorphic <italic>dlg</italic> alleles display underdeveloped subsynaptic reticulum, bigger glutamate receptors fields and an increased size of synaptic boutons, active zones and vesicles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Additionally to these morphological defects, altered synaptic responses such as increased excitatory junction currents (EJC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> and increased amplitude of miniature excitatory junction potentials have been observed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The strong morphological defects make difficult to distinguish developmental defects from the role of DLGs in the basal function of the mature synapse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. We have previously reported form-specific null mutant strains for DLGA (<italic>dlgA</italic><sup><italic>40.2</italic></sup>) and DLGS97, (<italic>dlgS97</italic><sup><italic>5</italic></sup>). These mutants do not show the gross morphological defects observed in hypomorphic mutants, although still show functional synaptic defects, supporting a role of DLG proteins in the mature synaptic function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>Here, combining genetic, electrophysiology and immunostaining techniques we dissect the role of DLG proteins at the pre and postsynaptic compartments. Our results show the specific requirement of postsynaptic DLGS97 for normal glutamate receptor (GLUR) distribution. In turn, both DLG proteins increase the release probability by promoting voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel localization. Our results demonstrate for the first time a relevant role to DLG proteins in the presynaptic function contributing to Ca<sup>2+</sup> mediated short-term plasticity and probability of release.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Isoform specific post-synaptic defects in <italic>dlg</italic> mutants</title><p>We have previously shown that flies carrying the severe hypomorph <italic>dlg1</italic> mutant allele, <italic>dlg</italic><sup><italic>XI-2</italic></sup> and the isoform specific <italic>dlgS97</italic> null mutant displayed increased amplitude of the spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic (junctional) potential (mEJP) without changes in frequency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. In addition all mutants displayed a decreased quantal content as measured by evoked post-synaptic potentials. Here we explored the specific defects behind these results. To characterize the synaptic transmission in WT and <italic>dlg</italic> mutants, we recorded post synaptic currents in HL3.1 solution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> on muscles 6 or 7 of third instar male larvae of the various genotypes. Recordings of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEJC) were obtained after blocking the voltage activated sodium channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Thereafter, histogram distributions were constructed with the amplitudes of the miniature events and the quantal size was estimated by the peak value obtained adjusting a Log-Normal distribution in each genotype. It is worth to emphasize that finding a phenotype on <italic>dlgA</italic> or <italic>dlgS97</italic> mutants means that DLGA or DLGS97 proteins by themselves cannot replace DLG function.</p><p>We compared the average amplitude of spontaneous postsynaptic potentials and, supporting our previous results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, we found that the average amplitude of the mEJC of the mutants <italic>dlg</italic><sup><italic>XI-2</italic></sup> (0.99&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.05&#x02009;nA) and <italic>dlgS97</italic> (0.98&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03&#x02009;nA) were significantly larger compared to the average amplitudes of the mEJC of Canton-S strain used as WT control (0.81&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.04&#x02009;nA) and of <italic>dlgA</italic> (0.78&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.02&#x02009;nA) specific mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>A,B). The same result was obtained comparing the quantal size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>B; WT: 0.72&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.02; <italic>dlg</italic><sup><italic>XI-2</italic></sup>: 0.91&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01; <italic>dlgS97</italic>: 0.89&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01<italic>; dlgA:</italic> 0.74&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.02). None of the mutants showed a significant change compared to the WT in the frequency of the mEJC (varying between 2 to 4&#x02009;Hz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>C<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). As an additional control, we recorded all mutants over a deficiency covering the <italic>dlg</italic> gene, finding similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>B). These findings are in accordance with the idea that DLGS97 protein and not DLGA is necessary for the quantal size determination.</p><p>Bigger quantal size could be of pre or postsynaptic origin as the result of increased neurotransmitter (NT) content in vesicles or increased glutamate receptor field&#x02019;s size respectively. First, to determine the pre or post-synaptic origin of this phenotype, we expressed a <italic>UAS-dsRNA</italic> construct that targets all <italic>dlg</italic> products, under the control of the motoneuron promoter OK6-GAL4 or the muscle promoter C57-GAL4. As expected for a post-synaptic defect, the increased quantal size observed in <italic>dlgS97</italic> mutants was mimicked only by the decrease of DLG in the muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>D,E; presynaptic dsRNA: 0.76&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.02 quanta; postsynaptic dsRNA: 1.03&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03 quanta). The specific role of DLGS97 in the muscle is supported by the rescue of the <italic>dlgS97</italic> mutant phenotype only by the expression of DLGS97 in the muscle and not in the motor neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>D,E). We looked at the effect of GAL4 expression in the mutant background in all experiments; neither of the GAL4 lines without the specific UAS constructs changed the phenotype of the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>E and data not shown). Again, none of the genotypes studied displayed differences with the WT in the frequency of the minis.</p><p>Changes in quantal size of postsynaptic origin could be due to higher number of post-synaptic receptors and/or a different composition of the postsynaptic receptors. An increase in the size of glutamate receptors fields has been described in <italic>dlg</italic> hypomorphic alleles including <italic>dlg</italic><sup><italic>XI-2</italic></sup> mutants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, in addition we previously showed that <italic>dlgS97</italic> but not <italic>dlgA</italic> mutants display bigger receptor fields<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Therefore, we compared the size of the glutamate receptor fields among the mutants and with WT and also measured the active zones using antibodies for the active zone protein Bruchpilot. Consistently with our previous results we found bigger glutamate receptors fields compared to WT only in <italic>dlg</italic><sup><italic>XI-2</italic></sup> and <italic>dlgS97</italic> mutants but not in <italic>dlgA</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>A,B second row). Surprisingly, we also found an increased number of active zones per bouton in all mutants, a phenotype usually associated with an increase in the frequency of minis that we did not observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>B second row). In addition, we found an increased active zone area in <italic>dlgA</italic> and <italic>dlg</italic><sup><italic>XI-2</italic></sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref> first row).</p><p>As expected for a postsynaptic defect, the bigger size of the glutamate fields in <italic>dlgS97</italic> mutants was rescued by the expression of DLGS97 in the muscle but not by its expression in the motor neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>C,E second row). These results confirm that DLGS97, but not DLGA is responsible for the regulation of the size of the receptors fields in the muscle.</p><p>The strict requirement of DLGS97 in the regulation of the size of GLUR fields supports results that have involved other DLGS97 interacting proteins in the regulation of the size of the glutamate receptors fields. METRO, an MPP-like MAGUK protein, has been shown to form a complex with DLGS97 and LIN-7 through the L27 domains present in each of the three proteins. <italic>metro</italic> mutants display decreased DLGS97 at the synapse and larger GLUR receptors fields than WT, even bigger than <italic>dlgS97</italic> mutants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. METRO and DLGS97 depend on each other for their stability on the synapse, thus, in <italic>dlgS97</italic> mutants, METRO and dLIN-7 are highly reduced at the synapse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The similar post-synaptic phenotype of <italic>metro</italic> and <italic>dlgS97</italic> and the reported interaction between these two proteins allow us to propose that the increase size of GLUR fields is consequence of the loss of METRO due to the loss of DLGS97 protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>As stated before, changes in quantal size of postsynaptic origin can also reflect a different composition of the receptors. <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ GLUR receptors are tetramers composed by obligatory subunits and two alternative subunits, GLURIIA and GLURIIB. Receptors composed by one of these two subunits differ in their kinetics; GLURIIB receptors desensitizes faster than GLURIIA receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Thus, the kinetic of the spontaneous currents (mEJCs), is associated to the relative abundance of these two types of receptors in the GLUR fields. It has been shown that the abundance of GLURIIB but not of GLURIIA in the synapse is associated with the expression of <italic>dlg</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. To analyze if <italic>dlg</italic> mutants display a change in the composition of the subunits abundance relative to the control we studied the kinetics of the mEJCs. Kinetics analyses of the mEJCs revealed that only <italic>dlgS97</italic> and the double mutant display a slower kinetic in the off response (see tau values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>,F), which is compatible with a different composition of the glutamate receptors fields regarding the proportion between GLURIIA and B receptors. The value of tau also increased in larvae expressing <italic>dsRNA</italic>-<italic>dlg</italic> in the muscle, but not by its expression in the motor neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>F). Finally tau-off values recovered the WT value only with the expression of DLGS97 in the muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>F). As we observed slower mEJCs, our results suggest an increase in the ratio of GLURIIA/GLURIIB. It is known that receptors containing the GLURIIA subunit display bigger conductance and slower inactivation kinetics than receptors containing the GLURIIB subunit. Thus, synapses with post-synaptic receptors fields containing proportionally less GLURIIB subunits would display bigger and slower mEJCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> similar to the phenotype observed in <italic>dlgS97</italic> mutants. To confirm this hypothesis, we evaluated the abundance of GLURIIA and GLURIIB receptors by immunofluorescence in the NMJ of WT and <italic>dlg</italic> mutant larvae. The immunofluorescence that allowed the detection and quantification of GLURIII and GLURIIB fields was performed with paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixative. However, the immunofluorescence to detect GLURIIA receptors only works fixating the tissue with Bouin reagent. Thus, in order to be able to compare between these two fixations, we normalized the size of the GLUR fields by the HRP staining that labels the whole presynaptic bouton. First, as a control, we double stained GLURIIA and GLURIII in the same larvae. Our results show that, in agreement with the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> using PFA fixative, GLURIII fields display bigger size only in <italic>dlgS97</italic> mutants and not in <italic>dlgA</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>A,C). Even more, as predicted from the kinetic data, only <italic>dlgS97</italic> and not <italic>dlgA</italic> mutants display bigger GLURIIA fields while there are not difference in the size of GLURIIB fields between WT and the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Additionally our results show no difference in the number of GLURIIA or GLURIIB clusters between WT and <italic>dlg</italic> mutants (data not shown). Our immunohistochemical results confirm the prediction from the electrophysiological data revealing that in <italic>dlgS97</italic> mutants, GLURIIA subunits are proportionally more abundant in GLUR fields than in control larvae. In conclusion, our results show that <italic>dlgS97</italic> mutants display larger quanta and mEJCs with slower kinetic establishing its participation in the regulation of the size of GLUR fields where the increased size is obtained mainly through the recruitment of receptors containing GLURIIA subunits. A similar result was obtained by Chen and Featherstone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> who observed that the loss of GLURIIB receptors in the NMJ of <italic>dlg</italic><sup><italic>XI-2</italic></sup> mutant embryos, these observation suggest that either of the two DLG proteins are necessary for the localization of GLURIIB in the synapse but only DLGS97 is actively limiting the size of the clusters by regulating the number of GLURIIA receptors.</p><p>Taking into account previous reports that show the regulation of the synaptic localization of DLG by CAMKII<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, the regulation of the subunit composition by CAMKII<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> and these results, we could propose a mechanism by which, after a strong activation of CAMKII, the phosphorylation of DLGS97 would detach it from the synapse allowing the increase of the size of the GLUR fields (mechanism proposed by Koh <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> for DLG) by the recruitment of GLURIIA over GLURIIB. These changes should increase the synaptic response by two different mechanisms.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Evoked responses unveil presynaptic defects in <italic>dlg</italic> mutants</title><p>To determine if DLG proteins modulate the presynaptic release probability, we recorded excitatory junction currents (EJC) in the muscle by stimulating the nerve at 0.5&#x02009;Hz in low extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0.2&#x02009;mM), both conditions to avoid synaptic depression. For all mutant genotypes the average peak amplitude and quantal content (EJC amplitude/quantal size) of the evoked responses were significantly smaller than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>A,B). In congruence with our previous results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, the lower amplitude of the current response is accompanied by a decrease in the quantal content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>B). Taking into account our results on the size of the GLUR fields in the mutant&#x02019;s muscles, these results are compatible with a reduction of the neurotransmitter release in <italic>dlg</italic> mutants. A decreased neurotransmitter release could be associated with a decreased number of release sites in the boutons. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>A,B (second row) and in previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, the number of active zones per bouton is increased in all <italic>dlg</italic> mutants with bigger active zones in <italic>dlg</italic><sup><italic>XI-2</italic></sup> and <italic>dlgA</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>B first row).</p><p>The decrease in the evoked response could be a consequence of the absence of the specific form of DLG in the postsynaptic side, transmitted by unknown mechanisms or, alternatively, it could be the result of an effect of DLG on the probability of release. In order to explore where this phenotype originates (pre or post-synaptically) we downregulated DLG levels by expressing <italic>dsRNA</italic> against all forms of <italic>dlg</italic>. Compatible with a presynaptic defect, the expression of <italic>UAS-dsRNA-dlg</italic> presynaptically decreases the amplitude of the evoked response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>C,D) while the same construct expressed postsynaptically using C57 promoter did not changed the amplitude of the EJCs (7.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.92&#x02009;nA vs. 25&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.9&#x02009;nA; presynaptic vs. postsynaptic expression, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>C,D). The presynaptic expression of the <italic>dsRNA-dlg</italic> also mimics the reduction in quantal content of the mutants, displaying a severe reduction in this parameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>C,D; WT: 31.67&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.7 quanta; <italic>OK6/UAS-dsRNA</italic>: 10.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.5 quanta, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0007). On the other hand, the postsynaptic expression of the dsRNA-dlg associates to a moderate but significant decrease on the quantal content, as expected from the effect already reported of the postsynaptic <italic>dsRNA-dlg</italic> on the quantal size and the lack of effect on the amplitude of the EJCs (<italic>UAS-dsRNA; C57</italic>: 24.27&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.84 quanta, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.047). The presynaptic effect of DLG is supported further by the rescue experiments. Thus, the amplitude of the evoked response and the quantal content in <italic>dlgA</italic><sup><italic>40.2</italic></sup> mutant is completely rescued by the selective expression of DLGA in the presynaptic compartment but not by its expression in the postsynaptic compartment (22.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.5&#x02009;nA and 13.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.5&#x02009;nA respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>E,F). The pre-synaptic expression of DLGS97 improves the synaptic function increasing the average size of the EJCs such that the difference between the WT and the presynaptic-rescue is not significant (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.49), suggesting a complete rescue. However, the average EJC in the presynaptic rescue is not different either from the control mutant animal (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.056), which we interpret as the rescue not being complete and thus we use the term partial rescue. <italic>DLGS97</italic> does not, however rescued at al the quantal content. This is explained because although the amplitude of the current increased, the quantal size remains unchanged by the presynaptic expression of DLGS97. In consequence the quantal content does not increase as much as the current. On the other hand, the postsynaptic expression did not increase the amplitude of the evoked current. However, since it does rescue the quantal size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) the quantal content augmented enough to be different from the mutant control (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.042; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>E,F). Notably, DLGA expressed presynaptically in <italic>dlgA</italic><sup><italic>40.2</italic></sup>mutants not only rescued the EJC amplitude but also the number of active zones per bouton and the size of the active zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>D,E). On the other hand DLGS97 expression only partially rescued the increased number of active zones in <italic>dlgS97</italic><sup><italic>5</italic></sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>D,E). These results support a role of DLG proteins in the presynaptic function where DLGA seems to regulate more aspects than DLGS97. Despite the fact that both forms of DLG share most of their protein domains, neither of the two-forms is able to fully rescue the absence of the other, suggesting that both of them participate in a complex. The binding between the SH3 and GUK domains of MAGUK proteins has been described; this interaction (at least <italic>in vitro</italic>) is able to form intra or intermolecular associations and offers a mechanism by which DLGA and DLGS97 proteins could be associated to recruit proteins to a complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p><p>Changes in the overall quantal content at these synapses may reveal presynaptic defects. However, genetic background and other independent modification could alter apparent release. To independently scrutinize alteration in the presynaptic release probability we look at two presynaptic properties, the short-term plasticity and the calcium dependency of quantal release.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Short-term plasticity protocols reveal calcium entrance defects in <italic>dlg</italic> mutants</title><p>To explore the EJC phenotype observed in <italic>dlg</italic> mutants we carried out stimulation paradigms that allow us to characterize aspects of the short term plasticity that are known to depend on presynaptic functionality and give us clues about the mechanisms involved in the observed defects. First, we studied the response of the mutants to high frequency stimulation, 150 stimuli at 20&#x02009;Hz. WT responses at high frequency stimulation show a fast increase in the amplitude of the response that then slows down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>A). The fast initial increase is called facilitation and the second phase with smaller slope is called augmentation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The time constant of the facilitation is believed to reflex the calcium dynamics in the terminal and its slope to be the product of the accumulation of calcium and the consequent calcium dependent increase in the probability of release<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The fractional increment in the mutants&#x02019; responses showed an increased facilitation in all mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>B), while an increased augmentation was only significant in <italic>dlgA</italic> mutants compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>C). Additionally all mutants showed a trend toward steeper slopes than WT, but only the augmentation slope in <italic>dlgA</italic> mutants reached statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>D). These results support that the mutants display a lower probability of release than WT, which could reflect defects in the calcium dynamics or in the response to calcium.</p><p>Previous work in <italic>dlg</italic> mutants did not report defects in short-term plasticity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. These works differ from this one in methodological aspects, mainly that they were carried out in a media with high concentration of magnesium (20&#x02009;mM) and calcium (1.5&#x02009;mM). Our work was carried out in a media containing low magnesium (4&#x02009;mM) and calcium (0.2&#x02009;mM) concentration. It is known that magnesium reduces neurotransmitter release, probably due to partial blockade of VGCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Additionally, magnesium permeates more than sodium and potassium through GLURs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p><p>To better evaluate the calcium dynamics in the terminal we carried out pair pulse (PP) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A,B</xref>), a well-known paradigm to evaluate presynaptic calcium dynamics. In PP, a second depolarization shortly after the first one carried out in low extracellular calcium concentration elicits an increased release of neurotransmitter thought to reflect the increased calcium concentration in the terminal reached after the first stimulus. According to this, and posing as the working hypothesis that DLG affects presynaptic calcium dynamics, we should expect that a second pulse would increase the release in a bigger proportion, since the first stimulus did not release much of the ready releasable pool. Conversely, a second stimulus given at high calcium concentration produces a decrease in the release of neurotransmitter, which is considered to originate in the partial depletion of the ready releasable pool at the release sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Thus, a second pulse at high calcium concentration should elicit a smaller decrease of the release since an inferior entrance of calcium should produce less depletion of the ready releasable pool of vesicles.</p><p>Consistently with a decreased calcium entrance, all mutants displayed increased pair pulse facilitation at low calcium concentration and decreased pair pulse depression at high calcium concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A,B</xref>). These results support a defect in the calcium entrance to the terminal as the underlying defect in <italic>dlg</italic> mutants causing the evoked stimuli defects. To characterize the calcium dependency of the release in the mutants we measured the evoked responses at different calcium concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>). It can be observed that for all the mutants and at most calcium concentrations, the quantal content of the evoked response is lower than the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref> left). The only exception is seen at 2&#x02009;mM calcium where the quantal content of the <italic>dlgA</italic> mutants and the control are not different to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref> left). However, even at this calcium concentration the quantal content of <italic>dlgS97</italic> and the double mutant <italic>dlg</italic><sup><italic>XI-2</italic></sup> are significantly lower than the control. To get insight about the release process we fit the responses to a Hill equation. This type of fitting better estimate the maximum responses and the EC50, which is masked in the overall release of different backgrounds. This is observed in the graph with the normalized responses by the maximal quantal predicted. The adjusted curves show that mutants reach the theoretical maximal quantal content at higher calcium concentration than the WT and that the EC50 for the mutants is diminished respect to the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figs 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S2</xref>). To confirm the presynaptic origin of the defect in the calcium dependency, we carried out the calcium dependency in the mutant genotypes expressing DLGA or DLGS97 pre or postsynaptically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6D,E</xref>). The quantal content analysis shows that only the presynaptic expression of DLGA in <italic>dlgA</italic> mutants completely rescued the calcium dependency, in line with our previous results that show the importance of DLGA in the presynaptic compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figs 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S2</xref>). On the other hand the presynaptic expression of DLGS97, although it rescued the calcium dependency, failed to rescue the maximal quantal content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figs 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S2</xref>). Observing the graph with the normalized responses, DLGA as well as DLGS97 both are able to restore the WT calcium dependency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6D,E</xref> left panels). The inability to rescue the maximal quantal content could be explained by the existence of synaptic compensatory mechanisms that allow to counterweigh the bigger quantal size in <italic>dlgS97</italic> mutants, which we showed before that is not rescued by the presynaptic expression of DLGS97.</p><p>Facilitation is thought to depend on the resultant of the calcium entrance, calcium release from intracellular stores and the clearance of cytosolic calcium. So, the defects in facilitation observed in the mutants could be due to a decreased calcium entrance but also they could be due to a defect on the clearance of calcium. In a preliminary experiment we measured the relative changes of the total intracellular calcium concentration in the bouton using the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCamp6f. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>, GCamp6f expressed in control flies (<italic>OK6-GAL4/UAS-GCamp6f</italic>) respond with a fast and transitory change in the cytoplasmic calcium of the boutons when they are exposed to a local pulse of potassium. The same experimental approach in <italic>dlgS97</italic> mutant larvae (<italic>dlgS97</italic><sup><italic>5</italic></sup><italic>/y; OK6-GAL4/UAS-Gcamp6f</italic>) reveals that the rise of the calcium response is significantly slower than the control; additionally the recovery of the response is also significantly slower (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig S1</xref>). These preliminary experiments suggest a defect in calcium entrance in the mutants but they also support a defect in the extrusion that hint to additional defects. Further experiments are needed to clarify the calcium kinetics involved since these experiments were measuring the bulk of calcium change and in doing this approximation, we are losing the nanodomain changes that are known to be the ones that regulate the neurotransmitter release<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>dlg</italic> mutants show altered distribution of voltage gated calcium channels at the synapse</title><p>Since the results described above including the calcium dependency of the release as well as the parameters of the short-term plasticity suggest that the calcium entrance to the terminal is impaired, a view that is supported by the preliminary data measuring the cytosolic calcium, we focus the next experiments on the calcium entrance. The main calcium entry to the terminal is the voltage gated calcium channel (VGCC) encoded by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene <italic>cacophony</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. We took advantage of a UAS-cacophony1-EGFP transgenic fly (CAC-GFP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> to study the distribution of the channel in WT and mutant genotypes. CAC-GFP overexpressed in WT background localizes in the synapse in a strictly plasma membrane-associated manner in big clusters closely associated with release sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>A<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). However, CAC-GFP overexpressed in <italic>dlgS97</italic> or <italic>dlgA</italic> mutant background displays a significant decrease in the expression accompanied by a more disperse localization with significantly smaller clusters, suggesting that the Cacophony protein might not be properly delivered or anchored to the plasma membrane in <italic>dlg</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>A,B).</p><p>We reasoned that if <italic>dlg</italic> mutants had a defect on calcium entrance, the over expression of calcium channels should rescue at least partially the phenotype. We took advantage of the fact that CAC-GFP construct encodes a functional channel and recorded from control and <italic>dlg</italic> mutants overexpressing CAC. As expected and supporting a decreased calcium entrance in the mutants, <italic>dlgS97</italic> and <italic>dlgA</italic> mutants that overexpress CAC-GFP display significantly bigger evoked EJCs compared to <italic>dlg</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>C,D), without a change of phenotype in the spontaneous currents (WT: 0.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.016&#x02009;nA, <italic>dlgS97</italic><sup><italic>5</italic></sup>: 0.98&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.12&#x02009;nA, <italic>dlgA</italic><sup><italic>40.2</italic></sup>: 0.73&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.02&#x02009;nA, compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>A,B). Additionally, the over expression of CAC-GFP partially rescued the pair pulse facilitation and the pair pulse depression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A,B</xref>) as well as the calcium curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>E).</p><p>The disrupted localization of CAC could result from the disturbance of a normal direct association to DLG or it could be affected indirectly. To test this we carried out an immunoprecipitation assay using flies that express CAC-EGFP in all neurons. As observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>F, antibodies against GFP were able to precipitate DLG together with Cacophony-GFP, supporting that Cacophony channel is part of the DLG complex in the boutons.</p><p>A possible interaction between DLG and VGCCs is the VGCC auxiliary subunits. The &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b4; auxiliary subunit (Straightjacket in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) increases calcium channel activity and plasma membrane expression of CaV2 &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> subunits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> and Cacophony<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. The &#x003b2; auxiliary subunit increases plasma membrane expression of several mammalian VGCC classes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Intriguing &#x003b2; subunits are also MAGUK proteins and they are able to release the VGCC &#x003b1; subunit from the endoplasmic reticulum retention. It may be speculated that DLG through their SH3-GUK domain might be playing the role of the &#x003b2; subunit.</p><p>On the other hand, in mammalian cultured neurons it has been proposed that a complex formed by the scaffold proteins LIN-2/CASK, LIN-10/MINT and LIN-7 is involved in the localization of VGCCs at the synapse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and that SAP97 forms a complex with CASK<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. The association of DLGS97 with LIN7 has been reported in the postsynaptic compartment in the Drosophila NMJ<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Furthermore, an association between the L27 domain of DLGS97 and the L27 domain of Drosophila CASK has been shown <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, however there are no reports of this type of association with DLGA. Another protein involved in the localization of calcium channels in the active zone is RIM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. <italic>Drosophila rim</italic> has been involved in synaptic homeostasis and the modulation of vesicle pools. Surprisingly <italic>rim</italic> mutants, display low probability of release and altered responses to different calcium concentrations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Recently it was shown that <italic>spinophilin</italic> mutants display a phenotype with bigger quantal size and GLUR fields size with a higher proportion of GLURIIA subtype of receptors as well as decreased EJCs and decreased pair pulse facilitation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. This is a phenotype very similar to the one described here for <italic>dlg</italic> mutants. The authors in this report did not explore the calcium channels abundance or distribution and here we did not explore the link of DLG to Neuroligins, Neurexins and Syd. It would be interesting to determine if there is a link between Spinophilin and DLG.</p><p>Taken together these results show that <italic>dlgS97</italic> is the main isoform responsible for the postsynaptic defects in the <italic>dlg</italic><sup><italic>XI-2</italic></sup> mutants; which comprise the increase in the size of the receptors fields and the change in the ratio of GLURIIA/GLURIIB. Our results as well support a model in which DLG forms a presynaptic complex that includes Cacophony where the absence of either form of DLG leads to defects in the localization of the voltage dependent calcium channel and to a decrease in the entrance of calcium to the bouton; which in turn affect the probability of release and the short-term plasticity in the mutants. The results described here highlight the specificity of the function of DLGS97 and DLGA proteins and describe for the first time an <italic>in vivo</italic> presynaptic role of DLG proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Drosophila stocks and genetics</title><p>The following strains were used: Canton S; <italic>dlg</italic><sup><italic>XI-2</italic></sup>; <italic>dlgS97</italic><sup><italic>5</italic></sup>; <italic>dlgA</italic><sup><italic>40.2</italic></sup>; <italic>UAS-dlgA-EGFP</italic>; <italic>UAS-dlgS97-EGFP</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>; <italic>UAS-CAC1-EGFP</italic> (<italic>422A</italic>) <italic>and</italic> Df(1)BSC288,w{1118}/BinSincy (Bloomington Stock Center, Bloomington, IN<italic>); UAS-RNAi-dlg1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> (VDRC 41134, Vienna Drosophila Research Center, Vienna, Austria); the motoneuron activator strain <italic>OK6-GAL4</italic> and the muscle activator strain <italic>C57-GAL4</italic> (kindly provided by Dr. Ulrich Thomas), All flies were stored and crossed at 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Male larval body wall muscle preparations were stained as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> for CAC1 immunostaining we proceed as described in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.

The quantal size was obtained by plotting frequency histograms of the synaptic events recorded during 2 minutes for each genotype and fitted by a Log-Normal function, the quantal size was obtained from the pick of the fitted curve. Both the quantal size and the amplitude are significantly larger than WT only in <italic>dlg</italic> and <italic>dlgS97</italic> mutants.
