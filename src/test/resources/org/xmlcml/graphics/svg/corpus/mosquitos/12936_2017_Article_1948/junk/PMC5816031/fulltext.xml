Despite sharing a similar name, the two receptors are structurally unrelated and their physiological role is unknown. Cocaine increases the level of dopamine, a key neurotransmitter in CNS motor control and reward areas. While the drug also affects dopaminergic signaling by allosteric modulations exerted by &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R interacting with dopamine D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors, the potential regulation of dopaminergic transmission by &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R is also unknown. We here demonstrate that &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R may form heteroreceptor complexes with D<sub>1</sub> but not with D<sub>2</sub> receptors. Remarkably &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>, &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>, and D<sub>1</sub> receptors may form heterotrimers with particular signaling properties. Determination of cAMP levels, MAP kinase activation and label-free assays demonstrate allosteric interactions within the trimer. Importantly, the presence of &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R induces bias in signal transduction as &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R ligands increase cAMP signaling whereas reduce MAP kinase activation. These effects, which are opposite to those exerted via &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R, suggest that the D<sub>1</sub> receptor-mediated signaling depends on the degree of trimer formation and the differential balance of sigma receptor and heteroreceptor expression in acute versus chronic cocaine consumption. Although the physiological role is unknown, the heteroreceptor complex formed by &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>, &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>, and D<sub>1</sub> receptors arise as relevant to convey the cocaine actions on motor control and reward circuits and as a key factor in acquisition of the addictive habit.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>acute</kwd><kwd>addiction</kwd><kwd>cAMP</kwd><kwd>chronic</kwd><kwd>dopamine D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors</kwd><kwd>ERK1/2 phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>label-free</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Ministerio de Econom&#x000ed;a y Competitividad<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003329</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">BFU2015-64405-R</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient&#x000ed;fico y Tecnol&#x000f3;gico<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002850</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">1150244</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="57"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>In advanced societies cocaine addiction is an important health and socio-economic problem. Cocaine use begins recreationally and the seeking behavior is based on a feeling of general well-being. Drug addiction is the result of plastic changes in areas of the brain that have dopamine as the main neurotransmitter, particularly in the <italic>ventral tegmental area</italic> (VTA) (see <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000fc;scher, 2013</xref> and references therein). The main consequence of cocaine consumption in the central nervous system (CNS) is an increase in interneuronal dopamine levels, which is not limited to VTA but extends to other structures, such as the basal ganglia (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Wise, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bradberry, 2008</xref>). It was thought that the inhibition of dopamine transporters was at the root of all the effects caused by this drug of abuse. However, there is strong evidence showing that cocaine exerts effects by a direct interaction with sigma receptors. Two different sigma receptors have been identified that are functionally and structurally unrelated. Although endogenous ligands are not known and the physiological function of sigma receptors is unclear, these receptors share the ability to bind cocaine. On the one hand, sigma-1 receptor (&#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R) is a chaperone that spans once the membrane bilayer and whose recently reported structure consists of a homotrimer (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, sigma-2 receptor (&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R) was identified as a member of the family of membrane-associated progesterone receptors; apart from &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R (PGRMC1), three other human members are identified: PGRMC2, neuferricin, and neudesin. They are haem proteins displaying a cytochrome b<sub>5</sub>-fold domain. While &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R dimerization affects proliferation and chemoresistance in tumor/metastasis <italic>in vitro</italic> models and xenograft- based tumor/metastasis models, the mode of action in the periphery and the CNS are virtually unknown (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kabe et al., 2016</xref>; reviewed in <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cahill, 2017</xref>). The interaction of &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R with dopamine receptors and the relevant role that &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R exerts on the modulation of dopaminergic signaling by cocaine has been reported. In contrast, no study has been undertaken to know whether the binding of cocaine to &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R results in dopaminergic regulation.</p><p>The role of &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R as relevant target of cocaine was suspected due to the moderate affinity of drug binding to the receptor (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Matsumoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi and Su, 2005</xref>). Therefore, it seems that the &#x0201c;physiologically&#x0201d; relevant concentrations of cocaine can both inhibit the uptake of dopamine and activate &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R. &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R-cocaine interaction intervenes in the triggering of locomotor and convulsive actions of the drug (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Menkel et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Matsumoto et al., 2001a</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Barr et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, synthetic drugs that act as &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R agonists and antagonists, respectively, potentiate (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Matsumoto et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) and reduce (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Matsumoto et al., 2004</xref>) cocaine actions. More recent studies have identified in both heterologous expression systems and natural sources an interaction between &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R and dopamine receptors (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Navarro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Moreno et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Borroto-Escuela et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, it has been suggested that dual antagonism of &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R and inhibition of the dopamine DAT transporter can effectively block cocaine self-administration (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Katz et al., 2016</xref>). <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Matsumoto et al. (2007)</xref> reported that treatment with synthetic drugs that act on &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R attenuates cocaine-derived behavior in mice. Although the selectivity of the compounds was poor, 1 year later, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000e9;sangeau et al. (2008)</xref> designed an approach for converting selective &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R ligands into &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R selective ligands that, importantly, showed anti-cocaine activity. Furthermore, it has been observed that treatment with &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R antagonists counteract locomotor stimulation induced by cocaine in mice (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lever et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Guo and Zhen, 2015</xref>).</p><p>An important physiological consequence of cocaine ingestion is an increase in motor activity, which is controlled by basal-ganglia brain circuits. Motor control is exerted by the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia and associated nuclei. Of the five types of dopamine receptors, the D<sub>1</sub> (D<sub>1</sub>R) is enriched in the direct pathway, while the D<sub>2</sub> (D<sub>2</sub>R) is enriched in the indirect route. The balance of the dopaminergic input in the two circuits results in fine-tuning motor control. The locomotor hyperactivity resulting from cocaine use probably reflects a lack of balance in these two routes. The objective of this work was to investigate how the binding of cocaine to &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R affects dopaminergic signaling mediated by D<sub>1</sub>R and/or D<sub>2</sub>R. We first investigated whether &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R interacts with D<sub>1</sub>R or with D<sub>2</sub>R and, subsequently, we observed how cocaine could affect in a &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R-independent but &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R-dependent fashion the signal transduction triggered by agonist activation of D<sub>1</sub>R but not of D<sub>2</sub>R.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R May Form Complexes with Dopamine D<sub>1</sub> But Not with Dopamine D<sub>2</sub> Receptors</title><p>Two different sigma receptors have been described, the non-opioid receptor, &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R, and the PGRMC-1 protein, also known as &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>. Despite the endogenous ligands are not known, the two sigma receptors may bind cocaine. While recent studies have demonstrated that &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R is involved in cocaine modulation of dopamine receptor function, a similar study on &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R-mediated modulation of dopaminergic signaling is lacking. We first evaluated in a heterologous expression system whether &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R may colocalize with dopamine receptors at the plasma membrane. Immunocytochemistry assays were undertaken in HEK-293T cells expressing &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R fused to Rluc and either dopamine D<sub>1</sub>R fused to YFP or dopamine D<sub>2</sub>R fused to YFP. The &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R expression was identified by a specific antibody against Rluc protein and a secondary Cy3 antibody, while dopamine receptor-YFP expression was identified by its own fluorescence. D<sub>1</sub>R (green) was detectable at the plasma membrane level while &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R (red) was expressed both in intracellular structures and at the plasma membrane, where it colocalized (yellow) with D<sub>1</sub>R (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>, left images). When a similar experiment was developed with D<sub>2</sub>R, similar results were obtained indicating that D<sub>2</sub>R and &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R colocalize at the cell surface (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>, right images). When the immunocytochemical assays were performed in cells pretreated with 30 &#x003bc;M cocaine for 30 min, the level of colocalization between &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R and D<sub>1</sub>R or D<sub>2</sub>R was similar, indicating that cocaine pretreatment did affect neither cell surface expression of &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R, D<sub>1</sub>R or D<sub>2</sub>R nor receptor colocalization. Next, we determined whether &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R may form heteromer complexes with dopamine D<sub>1</sub> or D<sub>2</sub> receptors. For this purpose, we took advantage of energy transfer assays and <italic>in situ</italic> proximity ligation assay (PLA), which allows the identification of close proximity between two proteins (&#x0003c;17 nm) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Borroto-Escuela et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Trifilieff et al., 2011</xref>). For PLA, HEK-293T cells expressing &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R and either D<sub>1</sub>R or D<sub>2</sub>R were treated with specific primary antibodies against &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R and against each of the dopamine receptors. Interestingly, the red punctuated signal around Hoechst-stained nuclei was much higher for D<sub>1</sub>R and &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R than for D<sub>2</sub>R and &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R (82 versus 27% of labeled cells) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref></bold>). Finally, we developed bioluminescence energy transfer assays in HEK-293T cells transfected with cDNAs for D<sub>1</sub>R-Rluc or D<sub>2</sub>R-Rluc and increasing amounts of cDNA for &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R-YFP. Interestingly, a saturable BRET curve was obtained (BRET<sub>max</sub> 50 &#x000b1; 3, BRET<sub>50</sub> 190 &#x000b1; 40) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref></bold>) indicating a specific interaction between D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R; in contrast, a linear signal was obtained between D<sub>2</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref></bold>) suggesting a lack of interaction between them. When the same experiments were undertaken in cells treated with cocaine, similar results were obtained for the D<sub>1</sub>R-Rluc/&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R-YFP donor/acceptor pair (BRET<sub>max</sub> 82 &#x000b1; 10, BRET<sub>50</sub> 680 &#x000b1; 200), indicating that cocaine did not significantly affect the interaction (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Expression of &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R-containing heteromer complexes in a heterologous expression system.

The unspecific linear signal obtained (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref></bold>) suggested that no interaction was occurring between the two sigma receptors. We then performed assays to investigate whether &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R and &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R competed for the binding to D<sub>1</sub>R. BRET experiments were then developed in HEK-293T cells expressing a constant amount of &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R-Rluc and D<sub>1</sub>-YFP and increasing amounts of non-fused &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R. The results indicated that &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R was not able to compete with &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R for heteromer formation since the energy transfer between donor and acceptor was not altered (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref></bold>). When a similar experiment was performed expressing a constant amount of D<sub>1</sub>-Rluc and of &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R-YFP and increasing amounts of non-fused &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R, the results indicated that low expression levels of &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R increased BRET signals; however, higher expression levels &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R were able to displace &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R out of the heteromer, as reflected by a significant decrease in BRET signal (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref></bold>). This result could reflect the formation of D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R heterotrimer complexes, where the interaction of &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R to the &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R-D<sub>1</sub>R complex could create a structural change in turn leading to increasing the energy transfer between Rluc and YFP. To confirm this possibility, sequential resonance energy transfer (SRET) assays, which permits detection of trimers (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Carriba et al., 2008</xref>), were developed in HEK-293T cells expressing a constant amount of &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R-Rluc and of D<sub>1</sub>R-YFP and increasing amounts of &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R-Cherry. The saturable SRET curve indicates that formation of &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R-D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R heteromer complexes was occurring (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G,H</xref></bold>). The negative control was performed by substituting &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R-RFP by the cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> receptor fused to RFP thus confirming the specificity of the triple &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R-D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R interaction (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref></bold>).</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R Activation Blocks Dopamine D<sub>1</sub>R Signaling</title><p>Our next aim was to characterize the functionality of the &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R-D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R heterotrimer structure in HEK-293T cells treated with cocaine. It should be noted that &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Navarro et al., 2010</xref>) and &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Johannessen et al., 2011</xref>) are endogenously expressed in HEK-293T cells; consequently, we used a siRNA approach to silence &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R or &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R expression thus impeding heterotrimer formation. When HEK-293T cells were transfected with D<sub>1</sub>R and siRNA for &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R, SKF-81297-induced a significant increase in cAMP levels, that was inhibited by pretreatment with cocaine or with the &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R agonist, PB-28, indicating that cocaine decreases D<sub>1</sub>R-mediated cAMP signaling function through its binding to &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref></bold>). When HEK-293T cells were transfected with D<sub>1</sub>R and siRNA for &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R, the results indicated that cocaine pretreatment potentiated agonist-induced cAMP levels, which was evidence of cocaine action upon binding to the &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref></bold>). The next set of results is consistent with a reciprocal modulation of signaling mediated by cocaine binding to &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R and &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R; while cocaine via &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R positively modulates cAMP levels, it inhibits cAMP signaling via &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R. Accordingly, no effect of cocaine was observed in HEK-293T expressing D<sub>1</sub>R and the two endogenous sigma receptors (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref></bold>). The lack of modulation exerted by cocaine upon simultaneous binding to both &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R and &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R likely reflects a balance which would, in a physiological set-up, depend on the relative expression of the two sigma receptors. In fact, when HEK-293T cells were transfected with D<sub>1</sub>R and both siRNA for &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R and &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R, cocaine or the specific &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R agonist, PB-28, had no effect, indicating that cocaine modulation over D<sub>1</sub>R depends on &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R and &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R expression (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3</label><caption><p>&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R modulation of D<sub>1</sub> receptor-mediated signaling in a heterologous expression system. cAMP determination experiments were developed in HEK-293T cells expressing D<sub>1</sub>R <bold>(A&#x02013;D)</bold> or D<sub>2</sub>R <bold>(E&#x02013;H)</bold> in the absence <bold>(C,G)</bold> or presence of 3 &#x003bc;g siRNA for &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R <bold>(A,E)</bold>, 3 &#x003bc;g siRNA for &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R <bold>(B,F)</bold> or both <bold>(D,H)</bold>.

When striatal sections of vehicle-treated animals were analyzed, it was observed that 38.5% of cells showed D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R complexes with 2.5 red spots/cell containing spots, while only 25% of cells showed D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R complexes with 2.1 dots/cell (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref></bold>). When Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats were acutely treated with cocaine, it was observed that both D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R complex expression increased. However, the D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R complexes doubled its expression while D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R complex expression suffered a slight increase (respectively, 54% of cells showed red spots with 4.5 spots/cell and 33% with 2.3 spots/cell). Interestingly, in the case of rats chronically treated with cocaine, the D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R heteromer complex expression was not affected (34% of cells showed red spots with 2.4 spots/cell containing spots) compared to control animals, while the D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R heteromer expression significantly increased (35% of cells containing spots with 3.4 spots/cell containing spots) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref></bold>). These results indicate that acute cocaine treatment strongly increases D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R complexes formation in striatal rat sections but chronic cocaine treatment only drives D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R complex expression. Then, we questioned if the cocaine-induced alterations in D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R complex expression had signaling consequences. To do so, we analyzed SKF-81297-induced cAMP production in primary cultures of striatal neurons pretreated with vehicle or cocaine for different times (from 0.5 h to 7 days). Interestingly, we observed that at short times SKF-81297-induced cAMP levels were further increased. In agreement with results in HEK-293 cells, cocaine binding to the &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R induced a positive modulation over dopamine D<sub>1</sub>R-mediated signaling. When primary cultures of neurons were longer exposed to cocaine (1&#x02013;7 days), SKF-81297-induced increase in cAMP levels was inhibited (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref></bold>). Taking into account the results in HEK-293 cells such effect seems associated to D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R complex formation and to the ability of &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R to counteract the SKF-81297-induced increases of cAMP. To check whether these interpretations were correct, i.e., if sigma receptors were responsible of cocaine-induced modulations over D<sub>1</sub>R-mediated signaling, primary striatal neurons were transfected with siRNA specific for &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R or &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R. On the one hand, cocaine pretreatment (0.5 h to 7 days) blocked SKF-81297-induced accumulation of cAMP levels in primary cultures of neurons transfected with siRNA for &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R, i.e., expressing D<sub>1</sub>R and &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref></bold>).

Although cocaine can bind to both &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R and &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R, they are not closely related and no common structural properties have been identified. With respect to the modulation of receptor-mediated signaling, a relevant difference is revealed by the formation of heteroreceptor complexes. On the one hand, &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R interacts with D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> dopamine receptors (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Navarro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Moreno et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, we here report that &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R may form heteromeric complexes with D<sub>1</sub>R but not with D<sub>2</sub>R.</p><p>Information on PGRMC1/&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R expression in brain is partial. <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Intlekofer and Petersen (2011)</xref> confirmed data by <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Krebs et al.

To our knowledge, information on expression in other neural regions is either absent or preliminary. Interestingly, a recently developed fluorescent probe tested in rat brain indicates that the receptor is more present in neurons than in glial cells (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>). Despite good <italic>in vitro</italic> properties, some of the radiolabeled probes that were developed for <italic>in vivo</italic> &#x003c3;2 receptor imaging have not reached the final objective (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abate et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Selivanova et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, recently reported <sup>18</sup>F-labeled PET probes, with enhanced brain uptake and &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R selectivity (in mice), show promise for <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of the receptor in the human brain (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Surely these novel tools will be instrumental to achieve a more detailed mapping of the receptor in the CNS, specially in those areas in which dopamine receptors are expressed. There is, however, strong evidence of expression in the striatum; for instance, a recent report shows that receptor agonist regulate dopaminergic input into the striatum and the receptor is presynaptically expressed the <italic>nucleus accumbens</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Klawonn et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, pioneering studies by Werling and colleagues showed &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R involvement in control of dopamine transporter activity in striatum (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Derbez et al., 2002</xref>) and that the striatal receptor was a target of cocaine (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Nuwayhid and Werling, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The results presented here and those already reported (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Navarro et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) show that in equivalent experimental configurations, cocaine binding to &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R improves the accumulation of cAMP mediated by D<sub>1</sub>R and inhibits MAP kinase signaling. Cocaine, via &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R, blocks D<sub>1</sub>-mediated cAMP accumulation and enhances MAP kinase activation. Importantly, similar results were obtained in HEK-293T cells and primary neuronal cultures.</p><p>D<sub>1</sub>R can form complexes and high- order heteromers by interacting simultaneously with the &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub> receptors, &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R being able to displace &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R, but not vice versa. <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Navarro et al. (2010)</xref> reported an increase in the plasma membrane expression of &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R after acute exposure to cocaine. When increase in &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R levels in the plasma membrane occurs, &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R is displaced from the D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R or D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R heteroreceptor complexes. Such phenomenon results in increasing the amount of D<sub>1</sub>-&#x003c3;<sub>1</sub> heteroreceptors and D<sub>1</sub>R signaling whereas, as reported by <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Navarro et al. (2013)</xref>, reducing D<sub>2</sub>R-mediated actions. However, in a longer exposure to cocaine, the signaling mediated by the dopamine D<sub>1</sub>R fits more with that occurring via a D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R functional unit. These data suggest that the initial cocaine-induced overexpression in the plasma membrane of the &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R is transient; once these levels decrease, due to internalization or other still unknown mechanisms, &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub> is the predominant receptor forming heteromers with dopamine D<sub>1</sub>R.</p><p>Motor control in the basal ganglia is achieved through a complex circuit composed of GABAergic neurons that contain mainly D<sub>1</sub>R (direct pathway) and GABAergic neurons containing mostly D<sub>2</sub>R (indirect pathway) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Grillner and Robertson, 2016</xref>). Fine motor control is achieved by a balance of dopaminergic signals, one via D<sub>1</sub> receptors, which are G<sub>s</sub> coupled, and another via D<sub>2</sub> receptors, which are G<sub>i</sub> coupled (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Jenner, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Gerfen, 2000</xref>). The deterioration of motor control by cocaine depends on the imbalance of the direct/indirect pathway, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Although the scenario is complex, cocaine is known to increase cAMP levels in cells expressing D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Navarro et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, cocaine seems to be increasing in the direct pathway the cAMP-dependent dopaminergic output, namely activation of protein kinase A and cAMP-regulated DARPP-32 phosphoprotein (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Svenningsson et al., 2004</xref>). Through the same receptor (&#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R), cocaine leads to a deterioration of the dopaminergic performance of the indirect route (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Navarro et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to the imbalance resulting from these &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R-dependent effects, our results demonstrate that trimers of D<sub>1</sub>, &#x003c3;<sub>1,</sub> and &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub> receptors may be formed and that cocaine acting on these heteromers reduces the negative modulation exerted by the D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R complexes.</p><p>The results here presented also show that the MAP kinase signaling pathway is particularly affected by the action of cocaine upon dopamine-sigma heteroreceptors. While in cells expressing the D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R heteromer, cocaine decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, cocaine did the opposite in cells expressing the D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R heteromer. It is known that ERKs are involved in the plastic changes induced by the consumption of drugs of abuse (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Radwanska et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation alters learned place-preference in a paradigm of drug-of-abuse consumption, whereas activation of ERK1/2 is necessary to establish the association between place preference and drug consumption (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Valjent et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2017</xref>). In this context, knocking down ERK1 has shown that enhanced ERK2 signaling and repeated exposure to the drug facilitate the plastic changes leading to drug addiction (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson et al., 2006</xref>). It should be noted that the temporal pattern of MAP kinase activation in the mouse brain is differently induced by addictive or non-addictive drugs (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Valjent et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2017)</xref> have described that D<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonists alter in cocaine-treated mice the length of <italic>nucleus accumbens</italic> postsynaptic densities, i.e., cocaine-induced long-term plasticity; however, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has not been described. According to the previous reports and to our results, it may be suggested that potentiation of MAP kinase pathway mediated by the D<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R heteromer may be the mechanism by which the &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R would induce long term neuronal plasticity. The predominant role of the &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R in acute cocaine use shifts to a more relevant role of &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R in the chronic condition leading to the establishment of addiction. In any case, the relative expression of the two receptors in a given neuron seems important in determining the fate of the cell when the drug of abuse is consumed.</p><p>In acute cocaine exposure, &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R modulation of D<sub>1</sub>R-mediated signaling prevails, but in longer exposures, there is a shift to regulation by &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R. Recently, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Singer et al. (2017)</xref> have determined that neuronal plasticity initiate 2 h after cocaine exposure. The mechanism of action described in this paper cannot explain some of the results reported by <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Matsumoto et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lever et al. (2014)</xref> who report that &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R receptor antagonists block the effects of cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion. It should be, however, noted that a recent report show benefits of a &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R -selective agonist, siramesine, for decreasing cocaine effects via reduction of dopaminergic and glutamatergic input to the striatum (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Klawonn et al., 2017</xref>). On the one hand, it is a reasonable assumption that &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R is more involved in the regulation of D<sub>1</sub>R signaling at acute exposure. However, it remains to be determined whether some of the results reported on the impact of cocaine on locomotion are due to the use of non-selective ligands, that is, ligands that can bind to both sigma receptors and alter their function. Alternatively, it may happen that &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R is also affecting the direct route in acute conditions. What our results undoubtedly indicate is that &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R becomes the main player in conditions of chronic exposure to the drug. In summary, some of the addictive and motor actions of cocaine are the result of a balance between cocaine-&#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R versus cocaine-&#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R impact on activation of D<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>2</sub>R (and D<sub>1</sub>R-D<sub>2</sub>R, see <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Perreault et al., 2016</xref>) in <italic>ad hoc</italic> CNS circuits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Cocaine-chlorhydrate was provided by the Spanish <italic>Agencia del Medicamento</italic> (Ref. n&#x000b0;: 2003C00220). &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R agonist, 1-Cyclohexyl-4-[3-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-5-methoxy-1-naphthalenyl)propyl]piperazine dihydrochloride (PB-28), D<sub>1</sub>R agonist (&#x000b1;)-6-Chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine hydrobromide (SKF-81297) and D<sub>2</sub>R agonist, sumanirole, were purchased from Tocris, Bristol, United Kingdom.</p></sec><sec><title>Fusion Proteins and Expression Vectors</title><p>cDNAs for human versions of D<sub>1</sub>R, D<sub>2</sub>R, &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R, or &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R cloned into pcDNA3.1, were amplified without their stop codons using sense and antisense primers harboring: <italic>EcoRI</italic> and <italic>KpnI</italic> sites to subclone D<sub>1</sub>R, D<sub>2</sub>R, &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R, and &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R in pcDNA3.1Rluc vector (p<italic>Rluc</italic>-N1, PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Wellesley, MA, United States) or <italic>HindIII</italic> and <italic>BamHI</italic> sites to clone D<sub>1</sub>R, D<sub>2</sub>R, &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub>R, and &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R in pEYFP-N1 vector (enhanced yellow variant of GFP; Clontech), or <italic>EcoRI</italic> and <italic>BamHI</italic> sites to clone &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R in a cherry-containing vector (pcDNA3.1Cherry).

The relative amount of BRET or SRET is given as a function of 100&#x000d7; the ratio between the fluorescence of the acceptor (YFP or cherry) and the luciferase activity of the donor (Rluc).</p></sec><sec><title>cAMP Determination</title><p>cAMP levels were assayed with different forskolin concentrations and cell densities to select the most appropriate conditions of the assay, which were 0.5 &#x003bc;M forskolin and 5,000 HEK-293T cells or 7,500 neurons. Transfected HEK-293T cells or neurons were incubated in serum-free medium for 3 h before the experiment. Then, cells were placed in 384-well microplates in medium containing 50 &#x003bc;M zardaverine (Tocris Bioscience). Cells were then preincubated with vehicle, the &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>R agonist, PB-28 (300 nM) or cocaine (30 &#x003bc;M) for 15 min, followed by dopaminergic stimulation with the D<sub>1</sub>R agonist, SKF-81297 (200 nM), the D<sub>2</sub>R agonist, sumanirole (500 nM) or vehicle. After another incubation period of 15 min, 0.5 &#x003bc;M forskolin or vehicle were added. Readings were performed 15 min later by the use of a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (HTRF) method requiring the Lance Ultra cAMP kit (PerkinElmer) and fluorescence readings (at 635 nm) in a PHERAstar Flagship microplate equipped with a time-resolved fluorescence optical module (BMG Labtech).</p></sec><sec><title>ERK1/2 Phosphorylation</title><p>To determine ERK1/2 phosphorylation, 40,000 HEK-293T cells/well or 50,000 neurons/well were plated in transparent Deltalab 96-well plates and kept in the incubator for 48 h. The medium was substituted by serum-free DMEM medium for 2&#x02013;4 h before initiating the experiment. Then, HEK-293T cells and striatal neurons were pretreated for 10 min at 25&#x000b0;C with vehicle, PB-28 (300 nM) or cocaine (30 &#x003bc;M) followed by the addition of 200 nM SKF-81297, the D<sub>1</sub>R specific agonist. 10 min after activation, cells/neurons were placed on ice and washed twice with cold PBS before the addition of 30 &#x003bc;l of lysis buffer for 15 min. Supernatants (10 &#x003bc;l) were placed in white ProxiPlate 384-well microplates, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was determined using the AlphaScreen<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>SureFire<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> kit (Perkin Elmer) and the EnSpire<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Multimode Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, United States).</p></sec><sec><title>Label-Free Dynamic Mass Redistribution Assays (DMR)</title><p>HEK-293T cells and neuronal primary cultures were seeded in 384-well sensor microplates for 24 h before the assay to obtain 70&#x02013;80% confluent monolayers constituted by 5,000 HEK-293T cells or 14,000 neurons per well. Previous to the assay, cells were washed twice with assay buffer (HBSS with 20 mM HEPES and 0.1% DMSO, pH 7.15) and incubated for 2 h in 40 &#x003bc;l/well of assay-buffer in the reader at 24&#x000b0;C. Hereafter, the sensor plate was scanned and a baseline optical signature was recorded before adding (10 &#x003bc;l) vehicle, cocaine (30 &#x003bc;M) or PB-28 (300 nM) for 30 min followed by SKF-81297 (200 nM) addition. All compounds dissolved in assay buffer. Then, DMR responses were monitored for at least 3,600 s using an EnSpire<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Multimode Plate Reader (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Waltham, MA, United States). Sensitive measurements of changes in local optical density mimicking cellular mass movements induced upon receptor activation were detected using EnSpire Workstation Software v4.10, and curves were normalized with respect to the baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><p>The data in graphs are the mean &#x000b1; SEM. The test of Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov with the correction of Lilliefors was used to evaluate normal distribution and the test of Levene to evaluate the homogeneity of variance. Parametric statistic methods were used, because results in the different groups showed normality and homogeneity of variance. Significance was analyzed by one-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett&#x02019;s multiple comparison <italic>post hoc</italic> test. GraphPad Prism software version 5 was used for the statistical analysis.
