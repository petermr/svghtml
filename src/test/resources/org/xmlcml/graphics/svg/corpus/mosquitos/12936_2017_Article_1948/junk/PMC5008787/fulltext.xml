Externalizing problems are marked by under-control of emotions (e.g. aggressive conduct and attention problems) while internalizing problems are marked by over-control of emotions (e.g. anxiety, depression and withdrawal).[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Among the externalizing problems, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is most commonly associated with elevated weight status among children. A systematic review of the literature showed that obesity and ADHD are possible comorbidities, especially among clinical samples.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, evidence about the association between weight status and other externalizing behavioral issues is mixed, and appears to vary by age. Studies among children over 8 years old and adolescents, for example, have found associations between excess weight and at least one measure of externalizing problems such as conduct disorder,[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] oppositional defiant disorder,[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] delinquent behavior,[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or bullying.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Other research suggests that there is no association between weight status and externalizing disorders in younger children.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In addition to a possible increase in externalizing issues, overweight and obese children may also be at higher risk of internalizing disorders such as anxiety[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and depression.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Again, the association between weight and anxiety or depression among children is quite heterogeneous and some studies show no association.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Of the internalizing problems hypothesized as comorbidities of elevated weight status, however, body dissatisfaction demonstrates the most consistent association with overweight and obesity.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>Elevated weight status and emotional and behavioral problems may be linked before children enter school. For example, in a study of U.S. children at the beginning of kindergarten, overweight girls, but not boys, had higher levels of teacher-reported internalizing and externalizing problems compared to normal weight peers.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] According to another study, weight status and externalizing behaviors were positively correlated as early as 24 months of age.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Very few existing studies include children pre-kindergarten, and findings from studies of preschool-age children show mixed results.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the association between child weight status and behavioral problems. Poor impulse control may lead to an overconsumption of food,[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] subsequent weight gain,[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and a greater exhibition of externalizing behaviors, particularly ADHD.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Increased sedentary behavior and emotional eating have been linked to internalizing behaviors,[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] which may be a form of compensating for an inability to cope with negative emotions.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Child behavior may also influence how and what parents feed their children. For example a study found that mothers fed more sweet foods and drinks to infants exhibiting either or both internalizing and externalizing behaviors, perhaps in an effort to calm them.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] Weight-based stigma is commonly hypothesized to mediate the association between weight and psychological problems,[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and children are stigmatized for being overweight as early as age 3 years.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] These explanations include common causes of weight and behavior, pathways that indicate weight status precedes behavioral problems, and pathways that indicate the opposite&#x02013;that behavioral problems precede weight.</p><p>The temporal ordering of weight gain and the development of behavioral problems has not been well established. Psychological problems in childhood or adolescence have been shown to be predictive of the onset of overweight among children followed two years later,[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and also predictive of adult obesity.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] The opposite has also been found, however, with weight status predicting psychosocial problems later in life.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] Thus, obesity seems to be a &#x0201c;dynamic process&#x0201d; in which weight status interacts with genetic, emotional, behavioral, cognitive and social factors, rather than a &#x0201c;stable condition.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>As described in detail above, most studies of childhood obesity and psychopathology have focused on school-age children and adolescents (5 to 18 years of age).[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Very few include children who have not yet entered kindergarten; notable exceptions include two studies using data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] Similarly few studies take place outside of Western countries, with most occurring in European countries, Australia, and North America.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The current study adds to the literature by focusing on an under-studied developmental stage (early childhood) in this literature and by considering a Latin American context, Chile. The objective of this study is to explore the association between weight status and behavioral problems in very young children. Specifically we examine whether sex and age modify the association between weight status and behavioral problems. Based on prior research, our hypothesis is that the associations between weight and behavioral problems become stronger across early childhood, and that this pattern is more notable among girls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>The Data</title><p>This study uses a cross-section of publicly available de-identified data from the Chilean <italic>Encuesta Longitudinal de la Primera Infancia</italic> [Chilean Longitudinal Study of Early Infancy] (ELPI), which is a nationally-representative sample of 18,310 children born in Chile between 2006 and 2011, and their families (data available from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.microdatos.cl/Encuestas/PrimeraInfancia/LongitudinalPrimeraInfancia">http://www.microdatos.cl/Encuestas/PrimeraInfancia/LongitudinalPrimeraInfancia</ext-link>). These children were selected using a cluster-stratified, random-sampling strategy, using the municipality as the primary sampling unit. The sampling frame included all registered births occurring between January 1st, 2006 and August 31st, 2009. Municipalities were stratified by socioeconomic level and selected using systematic random sampling with probability of selection proportionate to size. Municipalities covering the country&#x02019;s largest cities received a sampling probability of one to ensure inclusion. Children in municipalities were selected using systematic random sampling from the Civil Registry until the desired sample size for each municipality was reached. Data collection began in 2010 with interviewers visiting the homes of the selected children to collect data on physical, cognitive and socio-emotional development indicators; family background; and participation in early childhood development programs. Follow-up data were collected in 2012, at which time a supplementary sample of children born between the two rounds was added. Interviews were conducted with the primary caregivers of the children, who were the mothers of the children in 99% of households. The primary caregivers of the selected children provided voluntary and written consent to participate in the study. The ELPI was supported by the Chilean Ministries of Education and Labor,[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pennsylvania approved this research.</p><p>In our analyses, we used the second wave of the ELPI, when the children were 1.5 to 6 years of age. To participate in the behavioral assessment, children needed to be 1.5 years of age or older. The behavioral assessment was applied during a separate follow-up interview after the initial questionnaire was applied. As a result, for children that did not complete the behavioral assessment, we had their birthdate but not their assessment date. Therefore, we could not be certain of their age at the point in time when they would have taken the test had they in fact taken it and could not assess age-eligibility directly. To address this, we created a birthdate cut-off based on the ages of the children that did take the test to determine age eligibility for the children that did not take the test. Of the 17,209 age-eligible children, a total of 13,315 were assessed for psychological and behavioral problems (measures described below). Of children assessed for psychological and behavioral problems, 10,716 had complete covariate data. Missing child&#x02019;s current weight (8% of total observations), birth weight (8% of total observations) or length of breastfeeding (5% of total observations) were the primary causes of this reduction in sample size.</p><p>For missing covariate data, we substituted values from the child&#x02019;s baseline measurement in 2010 when available, which brought the sample size up to 11,207. To assess the potential for non-representativeness arising from the loss of observations with missing data, we compared key demographic variables of children in the sample to those excluded because of missing data.</p><p>We conducted a post-hoc power calculation to estimate the minimum detectable effect given the study&#x02019;s sample size. Using an alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 11,207 distributed unequally between exposed and unexposed groups, and taking into account the clustering of individuals within communities, this study had 80% power to detect a difference of 0.019 standard deviations.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Measures</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Weight status</title><p>Our main exposure variable was weight status. After receiving formal training on proper measurement of anthropometrics, interviewers weighed and measured the children during visits to the homes. Children under 2 years of age were weighed in the arms of their caretaker and the caretaker&#x02019;s weight was subsequently subtracted. Children over 2 years old and adults were weighed individually. The interviewers asked caretakers to remove their shoes and other bulky items (e.g. jackets) before weighing. Children were weighed without diapers, wearing a maximum of two light items of clothing. A SECA brand digital scale was used for all weight measurements. To measure length, children under 2 were measured lying down. A parent assisted the researcher in keeping the child still and straight, and the interviewer used a ruler or book and masking tape to mark the child&#x02019;s length against a measuring tape attached to a flat surface. To measure height in children over the age of 2, children were assessed standing with their heels, buttocks, shoulders and head making contact with a wall. The interviewer marked their height against the wall using a book or ruler and masking tape. All were measured barefoot and without hair adornments. Age- and sex-standardized body mass index (BMI) z-scores were calculated using standard techniques,[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and a binary variable was created to indicate normal weight or overweight/obese using World Health Organization definitions.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] Underweight children were excluded from the sample (&#x0003c;1% of children). While different cut-offs are generally used for 6 year olds,[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] we applied the same cut-offs to the entire sample population to facilitate comparisons across ages.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Externalizing and internalizing behaviors</title><p>Our main outcome variables measured child behavior. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) measures externalizing and internalizing behaviors as reported by a parent of the child during in-home interviews.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] There is strong evidence supporting the reliability and validity of the preschool- and school-age versions of the CBCL.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] The CBCL has been shown to work well in a wide variety of countries, including Chile.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] The preschool-age checklist was used for children 1.5 to 5 years of age. Externalizing subscales included aggressive behaviors and attention problems. Internalizing subscales included anxiety/depression, emotional reactivity, withdrawal and somatic symptoms. The school-age checklist was applied to children 6 years of age. This checklist included many of the same questions as the preschool-age checklist, but also had items related to socialization and following instructions, which are more relevant for children as they enter formal schooling situations. Externalizing subscales include aggressive behavior and disruptive conduct. Internalizing subscales include anxiety/depression, withdrawal and somatic symptoms. Because there is no international standard with which to compare, our sample served as its own reference. Age-adjusted z-scores were calculated within two-month age segments using the means and standard deviations from each age segment. The scores were centered on zero with a standard deviation of one. Higher scores indicated more externalizing and internalizing problems.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Covariates</title><p>The primary caregiver provided information on the child&#x02019;s sex, indigenous status (self reported belonging to or descending from one of the nine legally recognized indigenous groups of Chile), birth weight (referring to the birth certificate when available), and the number of months the child was exclusively or partially breastfed. The primary caregiver was weighed and measured during the interview, and her BMI was calculated. She was also asked to report level of education completed (primary education, completed secondary education, some higher education but did not receive a degree, and completed higher education). Wealth is a measure of household financial and physical resources and is often used as a proxy for socioeconomic status.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] In order to determine a family&#x02019;s wealth, we conducted a principal components analysis of household assets (refrigerators, washing machines, cell phones, internet access, computers, DVD players, microwaves, hot water heaters, video cameras, and cable connections), a standard approach.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] After rotating the factor loads using the varimax rotation, the first principal component was primarily defined by the presence of a computer, cellular phone and having an internet connection in the household. The first principal component was retained and split into quintiles for use in the models. Birth weight, months breastfed, primary caregiver&#x02019;s BMI, and wealth were all included as continuous variables in the models. Birth weight and primary caregiver&#x02019;s BMI were mean-centered.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Effect-measure modifiers</title><p>The child&#x02019;s age (in years) and sex were explored as potential effect-measure modifiers.

Analyses were cluster-adjusted using linearized variance estimation to account for unobserved similarities among children from the same geographic area.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] To examine the associations between weight and behavioral development across ages, we included interaction terms in our model, multiplying weight status by indicator variables for child&#x02019;s age in years. We also assessed whether the timing of the association between weight status and behavioral problems varied by child sex using three-way interactions. To do so, we added interaction terms multiplying weight status by the indicators for age and sex as well as interaction terms for each unique pairing of these three variables to our main effects models. We used a p-value of 0.1 to determine significance for all interactions as studies are frequently underpowered to account for interaction.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]</p><p>After seeing very little variation in the association between weight and behavior among the children ages 1 to 5 years old, we decided to conduct post-hoc tests of interactions using age as a binary variable (1&#x02013;5 vs. 6 years). Rather than multiplying weight status by indicator variables for each year of age, these interactions terms included a binary variable indicating whether the child was 1&#x02013;5 or 6 years of age. Post-hoc analyses of interactions also provided group-specific associations between weight status and behavior. We used a p-value of 0.05 to determine significance for within-group differences. We retained all potential confounders in our models based on their hypothesized associations with the exposure and outcome.</p><p>Because of the complexity of the sampling scheme, weights were included in the dataset to account for sampling probabilities and nonresponse. Applying the survey weights to the individual observations allows for extrapolation to the population of Chilean children born between 2006 and 2011.</p><p>We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess how using the same weight cut-offs for the entire population of children versus using separate cut-offs for children aged 6 influenced the results.

These findings were driven by girls, and were not significant for boys. A few studies have found no association between weight and behavior among children under 4 years.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] But some have found a significant association at this early age, such as a study showing an association between weight and behavioral development at 2 years old.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Another study among 4 and 5 year olds demonstrated small effect sizes in the relationship between weight and behavior.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] In a study among kindergarteners in the US, being overweight was associated with an increased odds of teacher-reported externalizing and internalizing problems among girls; in that context, overweight and normal weight boys showed no statistically significant differences regarding emotional or behavioral problems.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] A study among 5-year-old girls also showed that higher weight status was associated with lower body esteem. However this study sample did not include boys, nor children under the age of 5 years.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Another study found a small but marginally significant association between weight status and internalizing behaviors among kindergarteners. The magnitude of this association grew as the children aged through the third grade. However, unlike our findings, this study found child sex modified the association between weight and externalizing behaviors and not internalizing behaviors.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This evidence, combined with our findings, suggests that the strength of the association grows as children age, perhaps most notably among girls, and small differences at early ages may be hard to detect.</p><p>Our sensitivity analysis used different cut-offs to determine overweight and obesity among the 6 year olds. Because these cut-offs have a lower threshold for categorizing children as overweight or obese, the lack of an association between weight and behavior among the 6 year olds in this analysis could indicate that the association is only present among children with more extreme weights. Sex differences remained, however, with overweight/obesity being associated with more behavioral problems among 6 year old girls but not boys. The robustness of this finding suggests that the association between weight and behavior among 6 year olds is stronger for girls.</p><p>Our study adds to the literature by focusing on early childhood and a Latin American country. Additionally, we were able to explore the association by age and sex, providing a rich level of detail. This study also benefits from the inclusion of a validated measure of emotional and behavioral problems, the application of rigorous methodology in measuring weight and height, and the inclusion of a large, representative sample of children.</p><p>In spite of its strengths, our study is subject to some limitations. Our measures of emotional and behavioral development rely on parental reports, which could have led to measurement bias. Additionally, the subscales that comprise the externalizing and internalizing scales of the CBCL are slightly different for the 6 year olds than for the rest of the sample. If these subscales are capturing a different behavioral construct, we may be measuring a slightly different association among the 6 year olds. Given that the CBCL is designed to capture emotional and behavioral problems using age-relevant indicators, it is only natural that the assessment would change as children age in order to measure these latent constructs. Not all children had complete data, leading to the exclusion of a part of the original sample. Such underrepresentation could affect the generalizability of our results. After comparing those included in the final sample to those that were not included, we feel confident that the sample is representative of the broader population (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0161380.t003">Table 3</xref>). Because the data are cross-sectional, we cannot determine whether weight status preceded behavioral problems or the reverse. Additionally, while effect modification by age suggests the association changes over time, longitudinal data would be better suited to address this question. The cross-sectional and observational nature of these data also precludes us from drawing any causal conclusions.</p><p>Developmental theory may offer insight into why we do not see an association between weight status and behavioral problems except among the 6 year olds. Evidence suggests that children are not able to imagine what others think and perceive until approximately age 6.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] As a result, children younger than 6 may not be aware of more subtle messages about their weight status and the associated stereotypes. Even if they are aware of the messages, children may not use those external sources of information to describe themselves until they reach middle childhood.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] In early childhood, children are still developing the ability to draw comparisons between their own and others&#x02019; abilities.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]</p><p>Girls may be experiencing more pressure to conform to a body ideal at a younger age than boys,[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] which could explain why we see a more concerning association between overweight/obesity and behavioral problems among 6 year old girls. The social pressure for thinness is apparent in Chile. While body size is on the rise in Chile, body size ideals in Chile favor more slender shapes, especially for women.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] According to a study of body size attitudes among middle-school-age students in Chile and other Latin American countries, more girls than boys wanted to be thinner even though the majority already perceived themselves as thin.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] This preference for thinness seems to apply to younger children as well. In one study of mothers of primary-school children in Chile, mothers of overweight children showed more concern about their children&#x02019;s weight than mothers of normal weight children.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] In a study of mothers of children aged 18 to 36 months, the mothers of obese children reported dissatisfaction with their children&#x02019;s weights, preferring that their children be thinner.[<xref rid="pone.0161380.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] Girls may be subjected to more negative weight-related messages than boys, so that as children develop the ability to understand and internalize others&#x02019; judgments about them, the messages girls receive are more likely to cause them to internalize negative stereotypes.</p><p>If the association between weight and behavioral problems is largely due to poor impulse control, it may be that children do not gain sufficient autonomy over their food consumption until older ages, thereby masking the effect of poor impulse control on weight in early childhood.</p><p>This study contributes to the existing literature by identifying that weight status and emotional and behavioral development are correlated among child of an age to start elementary school, but not among younger children. This trend may mark the beginning of an association that grows as children age, playing an important role in children&#x02019;s continued development, behavior and performance in school. There are clear strengths of the study, including the use of a large, nationally representative sample of Chilean children. However, the strength of the association was small, and the data were cross-sectional. Future research could shed more light on the associations between weight status and behavior by using longitudinal data to confirm how the association between weight status and behavioral problems changes as children age. Additionally, we would benefit from studies that directly measure the experience of weight-based stigma to explore whether it mediates the relationship between weight status and behavioral development or that measure child eating behaviors and parental feeding practices to explore their role as potential mediators in the behavior to weight status pathway.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the research team at the Centro de Encuestas y Estudios Longitudinales&#x02014;Instituto de Sociolog&#x000ed;a&#x02014;Pontificia Universidad Cat&#x000f3;lica de Chile, especially David Bravo, Pamela Jervis, Nicolas Libuy Rios and Pamela Soto.</p><p>We also acknowledge support from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD R01HD065436) grant on &#x0201c;Early Child Development Programs: Effective Interventions for Human Development&#x0201d;, the Grand Challenges Canada (0072&#x02013;03) grant on Saving Brains: "Team 1000+ Saving Brains: Economic Impacts of Poverty-Related Risk Factors During the First 1000 Days for Cognitive Development and Human Capital", and a pilot grant from the Berkeley Population Center (R24 HD073964).
